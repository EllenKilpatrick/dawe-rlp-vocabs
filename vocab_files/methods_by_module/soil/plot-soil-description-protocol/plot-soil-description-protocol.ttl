  Describes important aspects of the soil surface within the plot in accordance
  with the Australian Soil and Land Survey Handbook (The National Committee on
  Soil and Terrain 2009), including plot identification and location details,
  slope, landform element and pattern, erosion, microrelief, drainage,
  disturbance, and soil surface condition (when dry). Critical to describe,
  measure and sample the soil profile, and assign an Australian Soil
  Classification.

  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the Plot selection and layout module has been completed to mark out
      the plot grid with sub- meter accuracy using the Trimble® R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the ‘Soils’ module and then the ‘Plot soil description’ protocol in
      the App. The App will automatically record the Plot name, based on the
      established plot you are working in, the Protocol, and the Date. Check all
      these details to ensure they are correct, and manually update if
      necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record who the plot soil description is Described by from the drop-down
      list of personnel affiliated with your user login.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Agency from the drop-down list of agencies affiliated with your
      user login.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Record the State from the drop-down list.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record a brief Location description (i.e., a general description to assist
      with plot re-location using distances and direction to landmarks).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select ‘Locate SW corner’ to launch the mapping interface and located the
      southwest corner of the plot with sub-meter accuracy using the Trimble®
      R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select ‘Add SW corner location’. The App will automatically record the
      Easting, Northing, Zone, Datum and location acquisition Method (i.e.,
      ‘DGPS’) based on the spatial data collected in the Plot selection and
      layout module.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traverse the plot to familiarize yourself with the soils and terrain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assess and record the Slope, including the Percent of slope tangent using
      up to three significant figures (e.g., 1%, 2.45%, 9%, 12.5%, 115%), the
      Aspect (degrees from north (360°); 0° = no slope), and the means of
      Evaluation, Class, Morphological type and Inclination using the codes in
      Yellow book. The Class of slope can help determine Landform pattern (see
      step 11 below). Refer to pages 18–26 and 127 of the YB for further
      descriptions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assess and record Landform pattern, include Pattern, Relief and Modal
      slope using the codes in YB. Refer to pages 47 and 55–72 of the YB for
      further descriptions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assess and record Landform element. Refer to pages 31–44 of the YB for
      further descriptions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assess and record Erosion (accelerated or induced erosion rather than
      natural erosion), including the Type, State and Degree of erosion using
      the codes in Appendix D. Refer to pages 133–138 of the YB for further
      descriptions.

      of the land surface), including the Type, Proportion (of gilgai components
      if relevant), Agent (of biotic relief if relevant), and Component of
      relief using the codes in Appendix E. Record the Vertical interval and

      Assess and record the abundance of Rock outcrop, including the Abundance
      and Lithology using the codes in Appendix K. Refer to pages 143–144 of the
      YB for further descriptions.
