  Collection of soil core samples at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm increments from
  the edge of the soil pit (<a href='#figure-1'>Figure 1</a>), sealing the core samples or storing them
  in zip lock bags, and post-field survey processing of soil core samples. Soil
  bulk density measures are collected so important soil parameters can be
  quantified, particularly carbon content.

    Collection of three measures at the soil pit at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd9d31f-9a77-4fc1-9eee-23ea8af32b95">Soil</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd9d31f-9a77-4fc1-9eee-23ea8af32b95">Soil</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The accuracy of the bulk density method relies on the precise collection
      of undisturbed soil in the bulk density ring. Ensure care is taken when
      collecting the bulk density samples, so that the total volume of the ring
      comprises of the soil sample, without hollows or voids.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Accuracy is also influenced by the proportion of coarse fragments in the
      soil and where significant compaction occurs as a result of inserting the
      corer. Coarse fragments (i.e. soil particles greater than 2 mm in
      diameter), need to be considered in determining soil bulk density.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If coarse fragments contained within any sample are estimated to
      constitute greater than 30% of the volume of that sample, then accuracy
      levels are compromised and the sample should be discarded. Try again in an
      adjacent area (i.e. another face of the soil point). However, if coarse
      fragment levels are still &gt;30% of the volume of the sample after three
      attempts, try somewhere else within the plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the collecting agency does not have access to required laboratory
      facilities, the bulk density samples collected as part of the survey
      process need to be suitably packaged and then forwarded to a certified
      laboratory for analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For sub-surface soil samples (i.e. depths of 10–20 or 20–30 cm), dig a pit
      to the required depth (i.e. 10 cm or 20 cm, respectively) and of
      sufficient size to accommodate the soil core frame, and sample as for
      steps 7–17 above. Ensure that no soil falls into the pit from the upper
      layer/s. When removing the ring (step 10 above) ensure that no soil
      material from the upper layer/s falls into the ring.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the soils are very dry or have limited clay contents the process may be
      enhanced by slight wetting of the soils and leaving them for a period.
      This increases the adhesion of the sample to ensure it remains in the
      ring. However, over-wetting can alter soil properties, and should
      therefore only be used as a last resort.

      along an edge of the soil characterisation pit.

    <p>
      Select the ‘Soils’ module and then the ‘Soil bulk density‘ protocol in the
      App. The App will automatically record the <em>Plot name</em>, based on
      the established plot you are working in, the <em>Protocol</em>, and the
      <em>Date</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Locate the soil characterisation pit at the southwest corner of the plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select ‘Record soil bulk density location’. The App will automatically
      record the <em>Easting</em>, <em>Northing</em>, <em>Zone</em>,
      <em>Datum</em> and location acquisition <em>Method</em> (i.e. ‘DGPS’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Clear litter and vegetation from a 30 x 30 cm area of the soil surface
      along an edge of the pit without disturbing the soil to any degree.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the plastic caps from a bulk density ring and put the ring,
      bevelled edge down, into the soil corer frame.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the frame over the cleared area. Using the mallet gently tap the
      frame into the soil until the top edge of the ring is a few millimetres
      below the soil surface. Depending on the presence and size of any soil
      coarse fragments the ring may need to be inserted further. If the soil
      surface is uneven, an estimate of the mid-point should be used. In order
      to avoid chipping or bending the cylinder on rocks or other unseen hard
      material (and thereby changing the volume of the ring) do not use
      excessive force when tapping the frame into the soil.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the frame and using a trowel or spatula, dig out the soil adjacent
      to one half of the ring. The spoil can end up in the soil characterisation
      pit.

      <li>
        <p>
          Using a spatula or knife carefully trim the soil until it is level
          with the top rim of the ring, cap the top of the cylinder
          <em>in situ</em>, insert a trowel a few centimetres under the cylinder
          and with your other hand on the top cap, remove the ring and excess
          soil ensuring the soil in the cylinder is not disturbed; or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Insert the trowel a few centimetres under the cylinder and with your
          hand on the top of the ring for stability, remove the ring and excess
          soil ensuring the soil in the ring is not disturbed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using a spatula or knife, carefully trim the soil at the exposed end of
      the ring until it is level with the rim of the ring. Ensure there are no
      hollows (i.e. the soil level does not go below the rim of the ring), or
      that the soil does not protrude beyond the rim of the ring. If the soil is
      clay, slightly wet the soil using a spray bottle and deionised/distilled
      water to assist to trim the soil flush with the ring ends. Care should be
      taken to not over-wet the soils as this may affect the volume through
      filling voids or expanding shrink/swell clays.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the soil is level with the end of the ring, with no rocks, gravel
      or air spaces (meaning the volume of the soil is not identical to the
      volume of the ring). If the soil is not level, reject the sample and
      repeat the process until a suitable sample is obtained. If an accurate
      volume cannot be obtained after three attempts along the other edges of
      the soil pit, then try another location within the plot that is
      representative of the soil pit location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Without disturbing the soil, cap that end of the ring.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Carefully trim the soil at the other end of the ring ensuring it is level
      with the rim of the ring (as above).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Cap that end of the ring.</p></li>
  <li><p>Place tape around the caps ensuring the caps are held firm.</p></li>
  <li>

      Label the ring with the plot code, sample number, sample depth increment,
      and collection date, and attach at barcode label.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the 'Scan barcode' button to scan the barcode label on the sample
      and link the core to the soil bulk density sample location and the sample
      depth.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps 7 to 18 for 10–20 and 20–30 cm sample depth increments.</p>

      If collecting soil bulk density samples from additional locations, repeat
      steps 5–19 at each location.
