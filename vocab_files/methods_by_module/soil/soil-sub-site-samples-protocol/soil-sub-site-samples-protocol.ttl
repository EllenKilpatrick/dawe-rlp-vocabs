  Collection of soil samples to capture variability in the upper soil profile,
  including exposing the profile to a depth of 30 cm at nine locations with
  differing microhabitat (e.g. bare ground, dense litter, sparse vegetation
  cover, dense vegetation cover) within the plot (Figure 1), capturing a
  photographic record of profile, capturing a photographic record of
  microhabitats sampled, identifying the soil horizons, recording if the
  horizons are atypical relative to the 1 m+ soil pit characterization (and
  noting the differences), collecting soil samples at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm
  increments, taking care not to sample across horizons, and post-field survey
  processing and storage of soil samples. Five soil characterization sub-sites
  are located within a 25 x 25 m soil sub-site zone in the southwest corner of
  the plot (Figure 1) for consistency with various national soil research
  programs and monitoring protocols.

  Terrain (2009) and McKenzie et al. (2008).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Locating sub-sites</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The 25 x 25 m soil sub-site zone in the southwest corner of the plot (see
      Figure 1) can be marked out using coloured survey pins.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The five sub-site samples from within the soil sub-site zone should be
      collected from the entire range of vegetation types, cover classes and
      litter classes (e.g. from bare ground to dense litter, through sparse
      cover of ephemerals or grasses or forbs, to dense cover of forbs, grasses
      or trees, etc.).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Likewise, the remaining four sub-sites across the remainder of the plot
      should also attempt to cover diversity present in vegetation and ground
      cover.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a sub-site is positioned relative to a tree or shrub, the distance from
      the tree trunk or stem should be recorded in the comments.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Soil characterisation</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The preferred soil sub-site sampling method is by digging 30 cm soil pits.
      The advantages of this approach include easy observation of vertical and
      lateral variation, compacting specimens is avoided, easy sampling of
      undisturbed horizons with little or no contamination, and easy to
      photograph exposures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider the alignment of the pit as this is important for good
      photographs of the pit face. Natural sunlight can produce sharp contrasts
      of shade and light that obscure subtle variation in the profile, though
      full sunlight without shadows can be satisfactory. Light cloudy conditions
      offer uniform lighting, which might be best. Orient the pit so that the
      face to be photographed will be illuminated by the sun at the time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      During excavation, protect the soil surface above the face to be described
      and sampled by laying a piece of heavy canvas or plastic sheet at that end
      of the pit. Place it to one side when you begin to collect specimens and
      use it to receive individual specimens as they are removed, before packing
      them for transport to the laboratory.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The face of the soil profile should be picked back to expose the natural
      ped faces where present. A non-reflective black or coloured tape with
      clear depth markings should always be used. Soil profiles are best
      photographed when moist, so they match morphological descriptions – spray
      water on dry profiles from a bottle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flash or flood lighting produces an evenly lit photograph but the
      resulting colours can be unnatural. When pits are deep the bottom of the
      face might receive less light. A reflective screen placed along the base
      of the pit ensures even lighting across the base of the profile. A
      sun-screen made from black cotton provides good shade when the pit cannot
      be aligned as preferred.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collect samples by progressive excavation of a vertical rectangular
      section, sub-sectioned by depth intervals or soil horizons or both. To
      obtain sufficient specimens from thin layers, it may be necessary to
      collect from a larger cross-sectional area than for the rest of the
      profile. Conversely, this may result in too large a specimen if depth
      intervals are increased deeper in the profile. Do not solve this problem
      by reducing the cross-sectional area of the section. To avoid bias, the
      soil profile should be excavated to a uniform cross-section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid contamination by incomplete removal of overlying material or by
      failure of side or back walls of the lengthening collection channel. In
      most cases, it is best to start from the base of the profile to minimise
      contamination.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every effort should be made to dig small 30 cm soil pits. However, after
      three failed attempts (due to rock, hardpan, water, etc.), the attempt
      should be abandoned and the reason documented, and soil samples collected
      down to the depth achieved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For efficiency, one field surveyor can locate and begin digging the soil
      sub-sites in different microhabitats while another digs the 1 m+ soil
      characterisation pit (see
      <u>Soil pit characterisation<u>protoco</u>l). </u>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sampling from existing exposures (e.g. road cuts, gully banks) is
      undesirable because the topsoil is often disturbed, absent, or overlaid
      with other material, and it is difficult to determine how representative
      the exposures are.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Horizons</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A soil horizon is a layer of soil approximately parallel to the land
      surface, with morphological properties different from layers below and/or
      above it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Horizons may be difficult to name, but should be named in the field.
      Opinions formed at the time of description are useful for later reference.
      Even less experienced surveyors should be able to distinguish soil
      horizons.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      With regard to horizon notation, the long-established usage in horizon
      designation is adopted. Emphasis is on factual objective notation rather
      than assumed genesis, as genetic implications are often uncertain and
      difficult to establish.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Horizon codes and description are listed in Appendix O. Refer to pages
      148–159 of the Yellow Book for detailed descriptions (The National
      Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Soil samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Even a less experienced surveyor should be able to identify the soil
      horizons, in which case sampling across soil horizons should be avoided.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When placing each soil sample into the applicable labelled zip-lock bags,
      take care to minimise disruption to any peds or aggregates. Coarse
      fragment components should be minimised in sample to avoid overfilling the
      bags. If necessary, samples can be sieved in the field using a 2 mm sieve.
