      Ensure the Plot selection and layout module has been completed to mark out
      the plot grid with sub- meter accuracy using the Trimble® R1, including
      the 25 x 25 m soil sub-site zone in the southwest corner of the plot (see

      Select the ‘Soils’ module and then the ‘Soil metagenomics’ protocol in the

      Locate nine sampling locations in different microhabitats, or microhabitat

<p style="color: orange">Aligning with soil sample sub-sites</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If undertaking the Soil sub-site samples protocol, the metagenomic samples
      can be collected from the same locations immediately before the soil
      sub-site samples are collected.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Mixed silica granules</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read <u>material safety data sheet</u> before handling silica.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prefill 9 zip lock bags per plot with ½ a cup of mixed silica granules
      prior to the survey. Prepare a safe, well ventilated working area and use
      the required PPE.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      More mixed silica granules than ½ a cup per zip lock bag may be required
      for damp samples.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Silica will need to be checked regularly and changed until the
      self-indicating granules retain their original colour.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Store spare silica away from food or beverages in tightly closed
      containers in a cool, dry and well- ventilated area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A change in colour (usually after 2–3 days) of the self-indicating
      granules reveals that the moisture absorbing capacity of the mix has been
      reached and it needs to be replaced with fresh silica.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To replace silica, prepare a safe, well ventilated working area. Using the
      required PPE, empty spent silica into a suitably sized empty airtight
      receptacle (e.g., 20 L bucket with lid).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace ½ a cup of mixed silica granules into relevant zip lock bags and
      reseal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not discard the spent silica. It can be reactivated by drying in an
      oven at 110°C for 2 hours or until the indicator colour reverts. Ovens
      used for food preparation are not suitable for this process and PPE
      recommendations should be always followed when handling silica.
