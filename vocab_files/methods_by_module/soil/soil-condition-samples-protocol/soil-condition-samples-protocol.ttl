    <p>
  Rapid, systematic collection of soil samples for downstream soil chemistry
  analysis to monitor soil condition, including collecting soil core samples at
  0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm from 10 locations (Figure 2), systematically located
  within the 25 x 25 m soil sub-site zone in the southwest corner of the plot
  (Figure 1), and post-field survey processing and storage of soil samples. This
  protocol has been designed for conservation practitioners to quickly obtain a
  representative sample of the upper soil profile for downstream soil chemistry
  analysis (e.g. soil acidity, soil organic carbon) and determination of soil
  bulk density.

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines-3">Additional guidelines</h3>
<p>The following points are adapted from Grealish <em>et al.</em> (2011).</p>
<h4 id="sample-grid-layout">A. Sample grid layout</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The north south grid lines are numbered as columns 1 through to 10, and
      the east west grid lines are numbered as rows A to J. The 0 m lines are
      not used for sampling as these line areas will become disturbed during
      plot layout and particularly near the southwest corner that is used for
      the staging area and digging of the soil characterisation pit (see Soil
      pit characterisation protocol).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sample locations are at the grid intersection representing a potential of
      100 points.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For each sampling event one grid intersection per column and row is
      selected. This is determined by randomly sorting the rows (A to J) and
      then allocating from first to last with each column (1 to 10).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This allocation will have no redundancy in the first sampling event. For
      subsequent sampling events if a randomly selected row for a column has
      previously been sampled (and therefore removed from the potential sampling
      population).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Candidate sampling locations for four sampling events are shown in Figure
      2.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure that the Trimble® R1 has sub-metre accuracy (approaching 50 cm if
      possible) when marking the southwest corner of the plot (before generating
      the sampling grid) and the sampling locations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The sample locations are at the randomly selected grid intersections
      points and are not to be relocated or substituted. This removes the need
      for judgement decisions to be made as to where the sample location should
      be placed such as may occur if there is ridge and furrow topography or
      variable surface micro-topography. The sample location is defined as the
      grid intersects position.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collecting-soil-cores">B. Collecting soil cores</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soil samples at each soil sample position will be extracted at 3 depths
      from the soil surface where soil mineral grains are encountered (surface
      depth = 0 cm). The samples are to be collected as a stack, in which each
      sample depth is collected from the same position and therefore is directly
      below the sample previously collected from above.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The soil surface (or zero depth) is considered where the mineral soil
      starts. It does not include grass thatching or a litter layer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To extract soil samples, it is recommended that a coring tube is used
      which is 50 mm in diameter. Preferably the core should be smoothly pushed
      into the soil and extracted. An alternative is to drive the coring tube
      into the soil using a hammer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The outside of the coring tube should be marked with the sample depth
      intervals. Each sample interval should be cored and extracted separately
      as this allows an accurate sample volume to be collected and reduces the
      impact of compression.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Care needs to be taken to ensure that the entire depth interval has been
      extracted and that soil material does not fall into the hole prior to the
      lower sample being collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collecting soil samples in this way allows a sufficient volume of soil to
      be collected for chemical analysis and when collected carefully allows a
      bulk density measurement to be obtained for each sample collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A bulk density measurement for each soil layer is required to allow
      weighed measurements to be converted to volume, and to identify changes in
      bulk density over time as this can mask or lead to misinterpretation of
      trends in soil parameters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some cases, the entire 30 cm interval will need to be collected as one
      core, the sample extruded out and divided into the three sample depth
      intervals. Care needs to be exercised, taking into account soil
      compression and dividing the soil core at the correct depth increments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This sample core method is effective in moist soils, but when the soils
      are hard, loose or dry then alternative methods for extracting the sample
      will be required. The soil spear is effective particularly in dry sand
      textured soils, but because of the small diameter (about 10 mm) multiple
      extractions of the soil at the sample location position may be required to
      obtain sufficient volume of soil. Where these tools do not work, then a
      shovel will need to be used to create a small pit to extract the soil.
      Bulk density cannot be calculated from these samples and a separate bulk
      density sampling effort will need to be conducted (see Soil bulk density
      protocol).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If coarse fragments (fragments &gt;2 mm) are a part of the soil horizon it
      is important that the sampling method used recovers a proportional amount
      of these fragments in the sample bag.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soil sample recovery may be a problem when there are too many coarse
      fragments, rock outcrop, large roots, vegetation cover, shallow covered
      bedrock, or soil conditions that are too dry or too wet.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When this occurs, the sampling location is not relocated or substituted.
      Instead, the collection of that sample location or layer is abandoned and
      a notation is made in the App as to why the sample was not collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All samples are to be collected in such a way to avoid cross-contamination
      of the sample – requiring careful extraction of sample, clean sampling
      tools and clean sample containe
