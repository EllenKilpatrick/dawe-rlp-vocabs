    <h3 class="list-paragraph" id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines for classifying vegetation
  across the project area. The methodology is similar to that of Sparrow and
  Leitch (2009) and involves collecting structural and floristic data at precise
  vegetation mapping points, located in areas of homogeneous vegetation
  representative of the visually distinct vegetation associations within the
  project area. At each vegetation mapping point, an approximate area of 10 x 10
  m centred around the point is considered when collecting the data.
</p>
<p>The following information is recorded at each vegetation mapping point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      GPS location, date and time (auto-recorded in the App, professional grade
      GNSS preferred (e.g. Trimble R1) but not essential)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Static photo (facing south, to minimise the effect of shadow and ensure
      consistent photos)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure of homogeneity (the shortest distance to a vegetation association
      different to the one being sampled; maximum input of 1000 m)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Visual estimate of the foliage projective cover (to the nearest 1%) for
      all flora species occurring at covers greater than 5%
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dominant growth form and maximum height for each flora species occurring
      at covers greater than 5%
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visual estimate of percentage cover for physical substrate components</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Vegetation growth stage class</p></li>
  <li><p>Disturbance class</p></li>
  <li><p>Fire history class</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vascular flora voucher specimens are collected when a species
      identification is uncertain.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once the data is entered into the App, a structural formation description and
  NVIS Level 5 (association) classification is auto-generated. A field ID name
  can also be assigned to the vegetation mapping points (e.g. VA1a, VA1b, VA2).
  This information is helpful for project area stratification, mapping and
  reporting.
</p>
<p>
  The vegetation mapping module can be done prior to other field modules to help
  inform the selection of plot and targeted survey locations, however this is
  not always possible or practical. In some instances, plots may be located at a
  similar location to the vegetation mapping points.
</p>
<p>
  The number of vegetation mapping points will depend on a range of factors,
  such as the survey aims, availability/accuracy of existing mapping, size of
  the project area and the variability of the vegetation (refer to post
  field-survey tasks). The greater the number of vegetation mapping points, the
  more accurate the vegetation mapping will be. For example, for a map scale of
  1:50,000, at least one vegetation mapping point is recommended in each
  visually distinct vegetation association per every 1 km<sup>2</sup> (Gunn
  <em>et al.</em> 1988).

  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if vegetation mapping is necessary and at what scale (see step
      4). This will depend on the:
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Scale, aims, requirements and budget of the project</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The availability, scale and accuracy (spatial and classification) of
      existing mapping
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Changes to the project area since previous vegetation survey/mapping was
      undertaken.
    </p>
  </li>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: it may not be necessary to undertake this module if
    the project area is small (e.g. &lt;5 ha) and the range of visually distinct
    vegetation associations are already represented within survey plots.
  </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine what needs to be mapped based on the scope of the project (i.e.
      all of project area or only areas to be impacted or managed).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determine if a reconnaisance survey is necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Verify the accuracy of existing information</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Confirm if a nationally threatened species/ecological community is
          present
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Undertake site stratification (i.e. mud-map of visually distinct
          vegetation associations) based on visual interpretation
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Collecting vegetation mapping point data during a
      reconnaissance survey helps to determine the associations present, to
      inform subsequent vegetation classification and selection of survey plots.
      Where a reconnaissance survey is unfeasible or unnecessary, vegetation
      mapping can be undertaken while travelling across the project area (e.g.
      to select plot locations or between existing plots).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Determine how many vegetation mapping points are required and how they are
      spread across the project area. There is no set standard however consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Project aims, requirements and budget</p></li>
      <li><p>Size of the project area/vegetation associations</p></li>
      <li><p>Number and complexity of vegetation associations</p></li>
      <li><p>Site access/practicalities</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Desired scale of mapping (the more points, the more accurate the
          output)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Coverage already provided by vegetation plots</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Environmental impact assessment requirements (e.g. sampling intensity
          and proximity to proposed development footprint)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any state level survey requirements.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: Vegetation mapping points should cover the range of
      visually distinct vegetation associations present, including common,
      threatened and exotic. Vegetation mapping points should be in areas of
      homogeneous vegetation. As a guide, for a 1:50,000 mapping scale, a
      minimum of one vegetation mapping point is recommended in each visually
      distinct vegetation association per every 1 km<sup>2</sup>
      (Gunn et al. 1988; Brocklehurst et al. 2007). Refer to <a href='#appendix-c'>Appendix C</a>.
      Recommended sampling based on mapping scale for sampling intensity
      recommendations based on the desired mapping scale. It is recommended that
      vegetation mapping points are at least 100 m apart to avoid
      auto-correlation.

      The mapping interface within the App will allow you to track your location

      Existing vegetation mapping can also be loaded onto the GPS enabled mobile

      (e.g. Avenza Maps). Although this approach does not allow for data
      collection and visualization, it will allow you to track your location
      relative to the mapped vegetation within the project area.

      Where there is uncertainty in estimating the homogeneity measure, be
      conservative in estimating the distance (it is better to underestimate to
      ensure homogeneity). GPS error should also be taken into consideration,
      particularly if the homogeneity measure is small. If working in large
      homogeneous areas, existing field mapping and use of the vehicle odometer
      may help to estimate the shortest distance to a different vegetation
      association to that being sampled.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where it is not possible to directly observe the distance to a different
      association (e.g. goes over dune crest), estimate the furthest distance
      that you are sure is within the same association (i.e. as far as you can
      still see the vegetation association from the point you are standing).
    </p>
  </li>

      The following growth forms are allowed for each stratum (these will be
      pre-filtered in the App based on species selection):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Upper – trees, tree mallee</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Middle – shrubs, low trees, mallee shrubs, tall grasses, grass trees
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ground – grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, lichens, low shrubs, ferns,
          grass trees.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only species that fall into the growth forms associated with each stratum
      will be available in the drop-down list for that layer (e.g. only species
      classified as trees or tree mallees can be selected from the upper story
      species lists).
    </p>
  </li>

      The structural formation and NVIS Level 5 classification is derived from
      the species’ cover, growth form and height data and will auto-generate
      once a vegetation mapping location record is complete. For a list of
      growth forms, height classes and cover codes, refer to the
      <em>Vegetation Resources</em> information provided as part of the

      Tracking of voucher specimens is of vital importance. Consequently, TERN
      have created printed adhesive voucher labels that have a barcode on them
      that can be scanned by mobile device software and linked directly into the
      App. The voucher labels are available from DAWE/TERN. Note that a separate
      batch of sequential barcodes are used for each plant voucher, as well as
      each leaf tissue sample. Therefore, care is need to ensure the correct
      label is being used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When entering a field name for the vouchers it is essential that the field
      name makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data
      collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the name is
      used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you must be
      consistent with its use across the project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The field names will not be made publicly available when the plot data is
      published, however herbarium staff will have access to your field names.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid using labels such as ‘Acacia sp.’. Use a descriptive word instead of
      ‘sp.’ (e.g. Acacia spiky); this saves confusion later regarding whether it
      was a genuine species in a non-identifiable vegetative form or not.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use consistent taxonomy across the jurisdictions following published names
      used in the Australian Plant Name Index.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collecting-vouchers">Collecting vouchers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when available:
      flowers or buds, leaf, fruit, and bark (for trees). See the
      <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a></em> module for an example. Try to minimise the number of
      individual specimens needed to represent each species by maximising the
      number of plant components (e.g. flowers, fruit, leaves) on each sample
      collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If available, collect young, actively growing material for plant tissue
      vouchering. Although it is inevitable that during some surveys only
      sterile or vegetative material will be available, such material should
      still be collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal material
      and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and Juncaceae.
      See the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a></em> module for an example.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in a small
      snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As a minimum requirement, press specimens by the end of each day’s field
      work. Pressing plants in the field ensures that none are lost and also
      speeds up the identification process as diagnostic characters will be
      better preserved when pressed soon after collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When pressing, use one folded tabloid sized newspaper sheet for each
      specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently – to a maximum
      of one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently for bulky
      or wet specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming mouldy.
      Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when collected.
      Place press in a dryer as soon as possible (or at least a warm, dry
      place).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate easier changing of
      papers and reduce the risk of damaging other specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight (either
      in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell walls
      enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be
      transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the vegetation
      mapping point from which it was recorded.

  B. Classification and analysis
</h4>
<p>
  Numerical classification of vegetation mapping point data can be performed to
  describe and delineate vegetation associations within the project area in a
  robust and consistent way (Thackway <em>et al.</em> 2008).
</p>
<p>
  A hierarchical clustering analysis can be performed on the structural and
  floristic data (post-field) to classify the NVIS associations at the
  vegetation mapping points. The vegetation mapping point data is converted to
  polygons by buffering the field location using the homogeneity measure. This
  represents the area in which the floristic data (and thus mapping class) is
  deemed to adequately describe the vegetation association (Sparrow and Leitch
  2009).
</p>
<p>
  This information is subsequently used to develop a vegetation map; the primary
  output for most studies. The methodology used to develop a vegetation map will
  depend on the project specifics, and should be clearly stated. Visual
  extrapolation of the classification at the vegetation mapping point ‘polygons’
  may be adequate for project-level vegetation mapping, but has limited use at
  the broader scale.
</p>
<p>
  It is more accurate, repeatable and efficient to use an image analysis
  approach to spatial classification, particularly over large project areas with
  sporadic field data. To perform such spatial classification requires satellite
  imagery at a suitable scale and taken in the right conditions (Sparrow and
  Leitch 2009). Satellite imagery of high spatial resolution has led to improved
  analyses, when matched with field data of comparable positional accuracy. The
  fusion of remote sensing datasets (e.g. Lidar combined with satellite imagery)
  and field based data has powerful applications to assess and map plant species
  composition (Blázquez-Casado <em>et al.</em> 2019; Yadav 2019).
</p>
<p>
  A range of techniques exist for the classification and mapping of satellite
  derived data. Sparrow and Leitch (2009) used a stepwise supervised maximum
  likelihood classification approach. This method analyses the spectral
  properties of each image pixel and assigns it to the class to which it most
  likely belongs, defined using the field data and statistically analysing
  pixels known to relate to each of the mapping classes (essentially training
  areas) that were determined from the hierarchical clustering technique. Some
  post processing tasks are required to improve the accuracy of the final
  mapping units.

    <h3 class="list-paragraph" id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Vegetation classification systems form a base for conservation management and
  the ecological exploration of the patterns and drivers of species’
  distributions (Addicott <em>et al.</em> 2021). Vegetation mapping is critical
  to document and assess biodiversity through space and time, and support
  biodiversity planning and management from local to global scales. Furthermore,
  vegetation classification and mapping are integral to Australian biodiversity
  laws and regulations (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2008; McKenzie
  <em>et al.</em> 2008; Gellie <em>et al.</em> 2018; Addicott
  <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  The NVIS is the nationally adopted approach to classify vegetation,
  underpinned by rule sets and mandatory data requirements to deliver
  standardised and comprehensive vegetation descriptions (NVIS Technical Working
  Group 2017). The NVIS consists of six levels of classification (Level 1 the
  simplest to Level 6 the most complex) (Table 10‑1). The data collected in this
  protocol facilitates classification at NVIS Level 5 (association) or Level 6
  (sub-association) with minimal observer bias, and enables the automatic
  generation of higher levels (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017) (Table 10‑5).
  This approach ensures the vegetation classification is consistent and
  comparable within and across projects and jurisdictions (Guerin
  <em>et al.</em> 2017; Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018; Addicott
  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and is suitable for inclusion in state or territory and
  national vegetation datasets (Executive Steering Committee for Australian
  Vegetation Information 2003).
</p>
<p>
  The vegetation mapping point method is much less labour intensive and hence
  much faster than other methods such as the quadrat or step-pointing method for
  the purpose of defining and mapping vegetation associations (Sparrow and
  Leitch 2009). Locating vegetation mapping points in homogeneous areas is the
  most compatible approach for vegetation mapping. Recording a measure of
  homogeneity means the vegetation mapping points are effectively ‘virtual
  quadrats of variable size’. This enables accurate spatial correlation between
  field data and remotely sensed imagery, to create robust mapping outputs
  (Sparrow and Leitch 2009).
</p>
<p>
  The collection of quantitative species-based cover data is considered
  best-practice for vegetation classification (Addicott <em>et al.</em> 2021).
  It provides the ability to measure change over time and under different
  disturbance scenarios, and is robust and readily defensible, helping to instil
  confidence in the classification in both legislators and end users (Sparrow
  and Leitch 2009; Addicott <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  This protocol requires visual estimates of foliage projective cover to the
  nearest 1% (for species over 5% cover and substrate cover), however accuracy
  is not assumed nor required to this level. The quantitative data can be
  converted to a categorical value in the pre-processing stage for analysis.
  This approach assists data re-use and is less subjective than assigning
  categories at the point of collection. Species with less than 5% cover are not
  considered a significant influence on the association definition or the
  spectral response and hence are excluded for efficiency.
</p>
<p>
  The tooling and integrated database to collect NVIS compatible vegetation data
  at defined vegetation mapping points provides users with clean, consistent,
  repeatable and spatially explicit data outputs to assist with vegetation
  mapping and reporting. Recording supporting information such as vegetation
  growth stage, disturbance and fire history helps to identify variability
  within the vegetation associations, and assist with site stratification and
  assessment (Heard and Channon 1997; Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007).
</p>
<p>
  Project-level vegetation mapping is generally based on the available
  ground-data (i.e. from the vegetation mapping points and survey plots) and a
  visual interpretation of vegetation association boundaries using aerial
  photographs or by the analysis of satellite imagery. Whilst this approach is
  appropriate, the result can be subjective and vary considerably between
  observers and projects, thus limiting the usefulness of the data at the
  broader scale (Sparrow and Leitch 2009). Post-field numerical analysis of the
  data (i.e. using a hierarchical cluster based analysis to classify the
  vegetation data, and image analysis to spatially classify the landscape) is a
  much more accurate, time efficient and cost effective approach at a landscape
  scale (Sparrow and Leitch 2009).
</p>
<p>
  The centralized collation of the data means it can be used to produce more
  complex classifications and improved mapping outputs, which in-turn will
  improve the information available to future users. For example, project data
  from across Australia could help to update NVIS classification and mapping and
  help to fill gaps in the current dataset.

<p>
  Classifying and mapping vegetation helps to simplify complex systems into
  discreet units, which are useful for landscape management (Addicott et al.
  2018). Vegetation mapping incorporates two essential elements: a
  classification of the vegetation, and a spatial attribution of that
  classification (Tierney et al. 2017).
</p>
<p>
  This module provides a standardised approach to vegetation classification,
  which can be used to inform downstream vegetation mapping, reporting and
  analysis. Structural and floristic data is collected at precise ‘vegetation
  mapping points’ within homogeneous areas of vegetation that are representative
  of the vegetation associations present within the project area (Sparrow and
  Leitch 2009). This data can be collected at any stage of a project, although
  collecting it at the start of a project helps to stratify the area and inform
  the location of plots and targeted surveys. Data is entered directly into the
  App and is additional to any plot-derived vegetation data.
</p>
<p>
  At each vegetation mapping point, the growth form, height and estimated
  foliage projective cover (to the nearest 1%) is recorded for all flora species
  occurring at covers greater than 5%. Based on this information, the App
  auto-generates a classification of the vegetation at the ‘association’ level,
  in line with the nationally adopted National Vegetation Information System
  (NVIS) (Thackway et al. 2008; White et al. 2012; Sparrow et al. 2020). A
  visual estimate of how far the association being sampled extends beyond the
  point of measurement (known as the ‘homogeneity measure’) is recorded for
  mapping purposes (Sparrow and Leitch 2009). Supporting information including
  vegetation growth stage, disturbance and fire history is also recorded.
</p>
<p>
  For small project areas and/or those with relatively few vegetation
  associations, vegetation mapping can be extrapolated from the vegetation
  mapping points and visual interpretation of aerial or satellite imagery. At
  larger scales, where ground data is sporadic and there are numerous vegetation
  associations to discern, the point data buffered by the homogeneity measure
  can be used to perform a supervised image classification to generate
  vegetation maps (refer to <em>Classification and Analysis</em> in the post
  field-survey task) (Xie et al. 2008; Sparrow and Leitch 2009; Uyeda et al.
  2020).
