    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>This module covers the procedures and guidelines for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stratifying the project area into sampling units and identifying potential
      plot locations based on a review of aerial imagery and spatial data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Selecting final plot locations in the field based on the results of the
      stratification process in combination with on-ground knowledge of the
      project area, to position plots in homogeneous areas that are
      representative of the environments present.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Stratification is initially a desktop exercise using satellite imagery and GIS
  layers, along with any other information relevant to the project to divide the
  area into a number of sampling units based on variables such as vegetation
  type, landform (slope, aspect), soil type and land use. Decisions on broad
  areas of interest are based on the best available biological and geographical
  information, as well as historical, political and logistical considerations.
  The plot selection process generally involves filtering the data at a variety
  of scales, to select potential plot locations within broader areas of interest
  to target areas that are accessible and control for environmental variability.
  The general location of plots will be decided through the desktop process,
  with final plot selection and layout occurring in the field after visiting
  potential locations and assessing their suitability.

      module – The <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module needs to be
      completed before the <em>Plot description</em> module. Plot selection is
      based on areas with homogeneous vegetation and landform, which are then
      described in the <em>Plot description</em> module.

          >Vegetation mapping</a
        ></em
      >
      module <em>–</em> Plot selection can be informed by the results of the
      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module and ideally, at least one plot should
      be located within each vegetation association identified. Many more plots
      may be required for large or complex vegetation associations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Interventions</em> module <em>–</em> Depending on the nature of the
      study, plot selection may need to consider the location and extent of
      management interventions.

    <h2 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="pre-survey">A. Pre-survey</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Compile and review any existing environmental, ecological, land use and
      spatial information relevant to the project area. The review should not be
      restricted to only spatial layers. Other useful datasets may include any
      past ecological survey information for the project area and surrounds,
      research into ecological communities or species and discussions with
      landholders/managers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review any state or territory guidelines to ensure that the survey is
      compliant or aligns with any legislation or recommendations relevant for
      the area. These guidelines can also indicate other useful sources of
      information or databases that can be reviewed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It can be most effective to use spatial data as a series of filters to
      first identify areas of interest, starting with broad layers such as
      climate or IBRA and then focus in using finer-scale detailed layers such
      as vegetation or soil type. Soil and vegetation data can then be further
      refined using other information such as slope, watercourses, fire history
      or tracks to pinpoint potential plot locations within these larger areas
      of interest.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Depending on the nature of the project and the type of analysis to be
      undertaken, some variables may need to be kept as consistent as possible
      (i.e. distance from watercourses, level of disturbance, slope, elevation),
      particularly if control and impact plots are being compared.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where plots may be located on pastoral properties, Indigenous land or
      other private enterprises, landholders/managers must be contacted prior to
      any surveys to discuss the project and obtain approval for the property to
      be included in the surveys. Their involvement in the decision-making
      process may provide valuable on-ground knowledge for locating and
      accessing plots and is critical in ensuring the longevity of monitoring
      plots with minimal disturbance. Access to plot locations should be assured
      for current and future field trips (White et al. 2012).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On-ground knowledge of the project area from landholders/land managers
      should be factored into the stratification process. It may also be
      beneficial to provide landholders or managers with a copy of the proposed
      plot locations before the field survey as they may be able to offer
      additional information about proposed locations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flexibility is required when selecting prospective plot locations during
      the desktop assessment process and selecting more plots than will
      ultimately be required may be beneficial in case some areas are deemed as
      unsuitable once they have been viewed in the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select back up plots in case weather or terrain prevent access to proposed
      plot locations, or other factors constrain the suitability of areas once
      assessed in the field (Heard and Channon 1997).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Undertaking a reconnaissance field trip after the desktop assessment and
      before the main field survey can help with the selection of suitable
      survey areas and inform the number of plots required. Alternatively, when
      planning a field survey, ensure that adequate time has been allowed to
      traverse the project area, assess prospective plot locations and confirm
      location of all plots before starting any plot-based modules.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replication should also be considered during the stratification and
      planning process. Refer back to the introductory chapter for more
      information about designing field surveys and determining the number of
      plots required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where appropriate, include details on the location of proposed management
      interventions or developments during the stratification and plot selection
      processes to ensure that plots can be used for impact and control
      comparisons. Paired plots may be the most effective method to achieve
      this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a BACI design is to be implemented, then project planning must ensure
      that at least one lot of surveys is undertaken before any management
      interventions or developments commence. During this process, it is also
      important to ensure that are necessary plots can be re-surveyed after
      intervention or development.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the rationale for the location of each prospective plot as this may
      provide crucial information to assist with final plot selection once in
      the field (e.g. Plot A1 has been selected because it falls within the
      <em>Eucalyptus leucoxylon</em> woodland area, has a gently inclined slope
      and a northerly aspect. It is approximately 200 m away from the access
      track and 100 m from the watercourse. It is spaced at least 500 m away
      from Plots A2 and A3).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To assist with the plot selection process, a stratification layer can be
      drawn up (in ArcGIS, QGIS or Google Earth) based on the relevant spatial
      datasets and uploaded into <em>the App.</em> Preliminary plot names can
      align with any sampling units defined in this layer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only upload spatial layers that are useful for the plot selection process.
      Spatial layers are large and adding multiple layers to the mapping
      interface may slow response times.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Copies of other spatial layers can be taken to the field in the form or
      hard copy maps or other mobile mapping software.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before uploading spatial layers to <em>the App</em>, clip any state or
      national datasets to the general project area, to reduce file size and
      allow layers to load quicker.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before leaving for the field, ensure that any layers uploaded or generated
      during the stratification process using the web version are available in
      the app on your mobile device.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-field-collection">B. Field collection</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the start of the field survey, the extent, distribution, and complexity
      of the project area should be assessed and compared to the plot locations
      determined during the desktop assessment. If necessary, adjust or add
      plots to capture the variation present, using the
      <em>Plot layer (field)</em> in the <em>Mapping Interface</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Spatial layers can also be turned on and off in the
      <em>Mapping Interface</em> to assist with plot selection and reduce
      loading times in the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To avoid any confusion, turn off the preliminary plot locations layer once
      final plots have been selected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Undertaking the <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module first may assist with
      plot selection in the field, as plots can be placed within all vegetation
      associations identified. If there are more vegetation associations within
      the project area than expected based on the desktop assessment, place
      additional plots within these areas. Large or complex vegetation
      associations may require additional plots.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review any information collected during the stratification and preliminary
      plot selection processes when in the field to ensure that final plot
      selection aligns with the criteria used to select each plot (i.e. may need
      a consistent slope across plots, or a specific distance from a
      watercourse).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plots should be located away from vegetation edges, roads, dams, troughs
      and other disturbances and should be representative of the vegetation in
      the surrounding location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Final plot selection and layout in the field should be undertaken by an
      experienced ecologist.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the plot name is not automatically generated, follow the naming
      convention when defining plot names and include the project number and
      other identifiers to identify control or impact sites and the replicate
      number.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before finalising the plot location, traverse the area to ensure that it
      is homogeneous. If necessary, adjust the location or alignment of the plot
      before marking the points around the boundary and the centre point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the plot is to be permanently marked, record the location of any iron
      droppers or stakes, and if labelled, the position of the label (corner or
      centre). This information will be available for any follow up trips and
      will help to relocate plots in the future.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Keeping a record of both prospective plot locations and final plot
      locations in <em>the App</em> provides an overview of the plot locations
      and can be useful to ensure that all vegetation associations are
      adequately sampled within the project area and the allocation of plots is
      proportional to the area of each vegetation association.

      Review available satellite imagery, vegetation mapping and other GIS
      layers (e.g. soil, landform, watercourses, land-use) to stratify the

      that capture the variation present across the project area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The stratification process often requires a number of steps to divide the
      project area into sampling units that are environmentally similar (i.e.
      areas of the same vegetation type, same land use) and then filtering
      within these sampling units to identify or control for other aspects such
      as slope and aspect, distance to watercourses, vegetation condition,
      threatened or target species records and accessibility (i.e. distance from
      tracks or roads, terrain; <a href='#appendix-2'>Appendix 2</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the available datasets have been reviewed, open <em>the App</em> on

      Create a GIS point layer with prospective plot locations. The number of

      From the stratification drop-down list, select the different layers or

<p>
  Ecological assessments and monitoring programs require survey plots that are
  representative of the environments within the project area (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). The stratification process and the final selection of
  plots in the field is important for the overall quality of the assessment and
  the value of the data collected (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). While purely
  random surveys are more statistically robust, they require a larger sample
  size and have been shown to be less effective at capturing ecological
  diversity, which is typically structured along multiple environmental
  gradients (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Poor plot layout and positioning can not only make the initial survey
  difficult but can also hinder any follow up surveys (White
  <em>et al.</em> 2012). In addition, poor designs make it hard to assess the
  effectiveness of management interventions or the impacts of developments and
  may hinder future decision making by presenting inaccurate results
  (Lindenmayer and Likens 2010; Smokorowski and Randall 2017). Insufficient
  sampling intensity and a lack of replication can also result in species not
  being detected and the variation present across the project area not being
  captured (Thompson and Thompson 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The use of the Trimble R1 allows recording of plot position (each corner and
  centre point) to sub-metre accuracy and is important for repeatability in
  monitoring programs, especially where plots are not permanently marked
  (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). This will help to ensure that the same area is
  monitored during each subsequent visit and thereby maintain good quality data
  (White <em>et al.</em> 2012).

<p>The <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module outlines the steps to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stratify the project area and identify key areas of interest and potential
      plot locations based on a desktop assessment of environmental, scientific,
      historical, and logistical information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Finalise plot selection and plot layout in the field based on the results
      of the desktop stratification process combined with an on-ground
      assessment of the project area.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A desktop stratification assessment is a process which helps to determine both
  the number and general location of plots within the project area. The way
  areas are stratified will vary depending on the size, aims, nature and
  location of the project. Stratification can occur at a range of scales, from
  broad levels such as bioregions and land systems through to finer scale
  measures such as vegetation type, topography and land management (White
  <em>et al.</em> 2012; Wood <em>et al.</em> 2015; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2018;
  Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2021). The stratification process generally involves a
  desktop review of GIS layers and satellite imagery to divide the area into
  sampling units and identify priority areas for survey. In some instances, this
  is followed by a reconnaissance field trip to evaluate the suitability of any
  areas of interest identified (Heard and Channon 1997; Freeman et al. 2015;
  Wood et al. 2015). Flexibility is required during the desktop stage, as the
  suitability of proposed plots will need to be confirmed in the field, so it is
  often beneficial to identify more plot locations than will ultimately be
  required (White et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>
  Plots are typically placed in homogeneous areas representative of the sampling
  units, with a consistent mix of vegetation, slope, relief and soil type (Heard
  and Channon 1997; Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009; White <em>et al.</em> 2012;
  Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). Plots should be
  distributed in a way to sample as much of the variability present in the
  project area as possible (White et al. 2012), with more plots required for
  large or complex vegetation associations (DEC 2004; Casson et al. 2009; Cleary
  et al. 2015; Eyre et al. 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Plot locations can also be tailored to the purpose of the project and can
  include areas of different condition, management or treatment (i.e.
  control/impact). For monitoring programs, it is common for two contrasting
  condition states to be selected, which tend to be Best on Offer (BOO) sites
  and average condition sites (Eyre et al. 2011; White et al. 2012).
  Furthermore, if projects include on-ground management interventions or impacts
  associated with development activities, baseline data collected prior to works
  occurring, allows an assessment of any ecological changes taking place over
  time (Manning et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>
  Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs are generally the most effective
  method to help isolate the effect of the intervention or development from
  natural variability (Smokorowski and Randall 2017). BACI designs are widely
  used in research, ecology and conservation but are particularly useful to the
  fields of environmental management and environmental impact assessment. The
  use of multiple sampling times before and after an impact or intervention
  along with multiple control and impact sites is recommended (Fisher et al.
