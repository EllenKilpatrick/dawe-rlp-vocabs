    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Fire</em> module includes the protocol for recording fire severity
  within the plot. The protocol involves recording the cover and height of fire
  severity attributes from the ground to the canopy at 404 point-intercepts
  along four 100 m transects within the plot, and trunk char height and soil
  char depth recorded from four locations within the plot.
</p>
<p>
  The protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for: setting up four 100 m
  transects (2 x N/S and 2 x E/W; see <a href='#figure-1'>Figure 1</a>); recording the transect being
  assessed and in which direction; recording point-intercept fire severity data
  at 1 m intervals along the four transects located across the plot (for a total
  of 404 point-intercepts); recording trunk char height and soil char depth from
  the four locations where the four transects intersect; and entering the data
  directly into the App. The guidelines provide further information on: workflow
  efficiency; using a laser pointer to determine ‘hits’; using a GRS
  Densitometer<sup>TM</sup> to view canopy intercepts; the rules for determining
  a ‘hit’; when to apply ‘In Canopy Sky’ (ICS); and taking trunk char height and
  soil char depth measurements.
</p>
<p>The <em>Fire</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>

    <h2 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="a.efficiency">A.Efficiency</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The point-intercept method works best when conducted with two surveyors,
      one using the staff and determining the point-intercept reading, and the
      other entering the data directly into the App.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The guidelines below provide additional information for various
      point-intercept situations so that the surveyor can make the most
      appropriate judgement to ensure consistency.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Accuracy and speed of collecting point-intercept data improves with
      experience. Laying out a set of surveyor tape measures along all the
      transects, rather than just one transect at a time, is more efficient.
      This is particularly the case if the survey team comprises more generalist
      surveyors and/or volunteers who can lay out the tapes while the vegetation
      specialist commences the point-intercept transects. Furthermore, the
      intersects of the four transects mark the positions of the trunk char
      height and soil char depth sampling locations.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-using-the-laser-pointer">B. Using the laser pointer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using the laser pointer takes the guesswork out of what is (and what is
      not) a hit up to 1.5 m. If you cannot see the laser beam on the ground try
      one of the following tips:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          You cannot see the laser because it is in the sun – rotate the staff
          so the laser is in a shadow.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The laser beam hits vegetation before it hits the substrate –
          temporarily move the vegetation out of the way.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The battery is flat – change the battery (always carry spare batteries
          and/or a spare laser pointer).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c.-rules-for-determining-a-hit">C. Rules for determining a ‘hit’</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where a part of a plant of the same species <em>and</em> growth form is
      being intercepted at different heights, the uppermost intercept is
      recorded as a hit and all lower intercepts are ignored. This includes
      plants that are intercepted with the laser pointer, touching the staff
      between the laser pointer and the densitometer, and/or intercepting the
      vertical line of sight through the densitometer. This rule holds true for
      multiple intercepts of the same species <em>and</em> growth form.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If part of a tree or shrub intersects the vertical line of sight through
      the densitometer, this is recorded at a hit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If foliage or branches of a live shrub/tree intersect the vertical line of
      sight through the densitometer, record each species name and estimate the
      height at the uppermost intercept using a rangefinder or other height
      estimation method (see
      <a href="#f.-estimating-vegetation-tree-char-and-scorch-height"
        ><u>Estimating vegetation, tree, char and scorch height</u></a
      >
      below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you intercept a dead, charred or scorched plant and can determine what
      the species is, this is recorded as a hit for that species but flagged as
      ‘dead’, 'charred' or 'scorched'.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you intercept a dead, charred or scorched plant but you cannot
      determine what the species is, this is recorded as the growth form
      (pre-recorded field names; e.g. ‘Shrub’, ‘Tree’) and flagged as ‘dead’,
      'charred' or 'scorched'.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d.-using-the-grs-densitometer">D. Using the GRS Densitometer™</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the graduated staff is adjusted so that the densitometer is at
      eye-level.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level both of the densitometer bubble-levels and then look through the
      instrument so that the sighting marks (cross hairs and circle) are
      aligned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If working in bright sunlight, a piece of coloured cellophane can be
      placed over the top of the densitometer and secured with a rubber band to
      reduce glare.

  F. Estimating vegetation, tree, char and scorch height
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measurements of vegetation height in the lower and mid strata can be
      rounded to the nearest centimetre from the 10 cm markings on the graduated
      staff.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tree and trunk char height should be estimated using a forestry
      rangefinder for rapid and accurate height measurements. The person
      entering the data into the App can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over
      their shoulder and record tree height when required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <em>Nikon Forestry Pro II Rangefinder</em> is designed for measuring
      the height of trees. It can log up to 250 measurements taken with either
      actual distance, horizontal distance, height, angle and vertical
      separation (difference in height between two targets), and three-point
      measurement (height between two points). Distance measurements can be made
      using either First Target or Distant Target mode depending on whether the
      tree is in front of or behind other trees.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When using a rangefinder, the distance and angle to the top of the tree
      are measured at the same time, and then the distance and angle to the base
      of the tree are measured at the same time. The internal calculator does
      the mathematics to calculate the height. Ensure you are far enough from
      the tree, at least the distance of the height of the tree, and can see the
      top and base of the tree.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be estimated using
      the following methods:
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Clinometer and tape (Department of Environment and Climate Change 2007)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mobile phone applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When using a clinometer, find a place to stand where you can see the top
      of the tree. Your distance from the tree should at least be equal to the
      height of the tree. Measure the distance to the tree and your eye height
      using a tape. Look through the clinometer with one eye and at the tree
      with the other eye. Line up the crosshair in the clinometer with the top
      of the tree. Read the value on the percent scale. This gives you the
      tree's height as a percentage of the distance from the tree (e.g. a
      reading of 50% means the height of the tree is half the distance you are
      from the tree).
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Tree height = clinometer reading / 100 x distance to tree + eye
            height</em
          >
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol start="2" type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          On sloping ground, two readings will need to be taken (treetop
          (reading 1) and tree base (reading 2)). When the tree base is below
          eye level, the two percent values are added. Calculate the height of
          the tree using the equation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 + clinometer reading 2) / 100 x
            distance to tree</em
          >
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol start="3" type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          When the tree base is above eye level, the tree base percent is
          subtracted from the treetop percent. Calculate the height of the tree
          using the following equation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 - clinometer reading 2) / 100 x
            distance to tree</em

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      There are several mobile phone applications that provide an estimate of
      tree height by using the device’s sensors to measure the angles to the top
      and bottom of the tree. Like the clinometer guidelines above, a
      measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the
      height. Some apps allow the user to enter a measurement made with a tape,
      while others allow the user to enter and store the distance of their
      stride, and then enter the number of strides into the app to calculate the
      distance to the tree. Certain apps (e.g. Arboreal – Tree Height) make use
      of the device’s augmented reality technology to measure this distance,
      whereby the user moves close to the trunk of a tree (within 1 m), moves
      the device to locate the tree, aims at the tree and presses mark, holds
      the device upright while walking away from the tree to about the same
      length as the tree height, and presses mark again to calculate the
      distance.

      transects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record your starting point from the drop-down list (i.e. N2, N4, S2, S4,
      E2, E4, W2 or W4). This records the transect you are on and the direction
      you are travelling in (e.g. ‘N2’ means you are travelling south on the
      N2/S2 transect, while ‘S4’ means you are travelling north on the N4/S4
      transect).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the bottom of the staff at the 0 m mark of the tape measure. Ensure
      the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is pointing downwards so the
      laser beam will intercept the ground near the base of the staff.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For each point-intercept, begin by recording the nature of the substrate
      that is intercepted by the laser beam. Press the button on the laser
      pointer. If the laser beam is intercepted by vegetation, move the
      vegetation aside so that the laser beam reaches the substrate. Select the
      substrate from the drop-down list in the App (see <a href="#appendix-c">Appendix C</a>). The
      additional substrates available to record in burnt plots include ‘Black
      Ash’ and ‘White Ash’, and you can also mark ‘Bare’, ‘Litter’ and ‘CWD’ as
      ‘Charred’, and ‘Litter’ as ‘Scorched’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Next record the vascular plants that are intercepted with the laser
      pointer, touching the staff between the laser pointer and the
      densitometer, and/or intercepting the vertical line of sight through the
      densitometer. Where a part of a plant of the same species <em>and</em>
      growth form is being intercepted at different heights, the uppermost
      intercept is recorded as a hit and all lower intercepts are ignored. This
      rule holds true for multiple intercepts of the same species
      <em>and</em> growth form (see <a href="#appendix-d">Appendix D</a>). Record the plant’s species name
      and growth form along with the uppermost height at the point-intercept.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If no part of the foliage or branches are sighted in the cross hairs of
      the densitometer but the vertical line of sight is still within the canopy
      boundary, flag as ‘In Canopy Sky’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flag it the plant is regenerating. Record if the regeneration type is
      ‘Basal’, ‘Epicormic’ or ‘Apical’, from the drop-down list in the App.
      Record the uppermost height of the regenerating vegetation that is
      intercepted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flag if the plant is dead, charred and/or scorched at the point-intercept.
      Record the uppermost height of char and/or scorch that is intercepted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the plant is dead, charred and/or scorched and you cannot determine
      what the species is, record the growth form (pre-recorded field names;
      e.g. ‘Shrub’, ‘Tree’) and flag it as ‘dead’, 'charred' or 'scorched'.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat steps 11 to 15 for all other plant species that are intercepted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat steps 10 to 16 at every 1 m interval along the transect. This will
      give a total of 101 point-intercepts for the transect.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat steps 5 to 17 for each of the remaining fire severity
      point-intercept transects until all 4 have been completed. This will give
      404 point-intercepts for the plot.

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Fire is a prevalent ecological process in Australia that shapes landscape
  patterns and ecosystem processes through its influence on vegetation
  distribution and structure (Bond and Keeley 2005; Bowman
  <em>et al.</em> 2009), and to which the flora and fauna are adapted (Johnson
  1995; Gosper <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, fire
  frequency, duration, extent and intensity, as well as the length of the fire
  season, are predicted to increase in Australia in response to climatic drivers
  and natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2020;
  Etchells <em>et al.</em> 2020; Godfree <em>et al.</em> 2021). The predicted
  shift in Australia's fire regime is likely to have critical consequences for
  biodiversity, landscape patterns and ecosystem processes due to increased fire
  severity and associated changes in post-fire recovery. Understanding of fire
  severity is therefore pivotal to ensure adaptive management strategies
  suitable for the prevailing fire regime can be developed.
</p>
<p>
  Fire severity is commonly described in discrete categorical classes that range
  from unburnt or low to high or extreme (see <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>), with the classes and
  parameters used to distinguish these categories varying considerably between
  studies (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004; Hammill and Bradstock 2006;
  Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008). Furthermore, Australia’s States
  and Territories all map and assess fire severity differently, which has led to
  inconsistent and incomplete datasets. The lack of standardised data inhibits
  the ability to accurately quantify the scale and ecological impact of fires
  across the country (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Field-based fire severity classification is predominantly based on a visual
  estimate of the degree of impact from a fire, including estimates of the cover
  of burnt material in each stratum and comparisons to reference photographs of
  each class (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004; Hammill and Bradstock 2006;
  Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008). This approach can lead to
  classification discrepancies due to differences in observer interpretation
  (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004). Similarly, estimating vegetation cover visually
  using cover classes (e.g. Braun-Blanquet 1932) can be biased, imprecise and
  poor at detecting change since classes are often too broad (Vittoz and Guisan
  2007; Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009).
</p>
<p>
  Rather than visually classifying a plot into a fire severity category, the
  <em>Fire</em> module collects quantitative field measurements of fire severity
  attributes using the point-intercept method, which is an objective, repeatable
  and precise method to assess cover for all strata (Vittoz and Guisan 2007;
  Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bonham 2013). The method is
  straightforward and allows for detailed spatial and temporal comparisons of
  cover between plot samples with minimal uncertainty from measurement method or
  observer variation (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017), including the detection of
  subtle changes in cover (Brady <em>et al.</em> 1995). Furthermore,
  quantitative field measurements can be used to develop continuous fire
  severity indices (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013).
</p>
<p>
  At each point-intercept, the only decision is whether the laser beam
  intersects the substrate, species or lifeform, or a canopy hit is recorded
  using the densitometer, which minimises observer error and variability (Vittoz
  and Guisan 2007; Clarke 2009). Data is collected from a total of 404
  point-intercepts along four 100 m transects in a grid layout (2 N/S and 2
  E/W). This provides a reliable measure of the cover and patchiness of burnt
  and unburnt substrate and vegetation in each stratum, and is appropriate for
  detecting overall change at the plot level for surveillance monitoring.
  Measuring patchiness provides insight into the implications on population
  dynamics of fire-interval sensitive plant species, with small amounts of
  patchiness being shown to substantially enhance their survival (Oliveira
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, measures of patchiness can provide insight
  into potential impacts of fire on fauna (Noske 1992; Trainor
  <em>et al.</em> 2000; Fraser <em>et al.</em> 2003; Andersen
  <em>et al.</em> 2005). See the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a></em> module for a detailed rationale
  of the point-intercept method.
</p>
<p>
  The fire severity attributes to quantify fire severity in the plot were
  selected based on attributes that are commonly used to classify fire severity
  (Whight and Bradstock 1999; Hammill and Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and
  Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015) and used in fire
  severity indices (Whight and Bradstock 1999; Key and Benson 2006; Jain
  <em>et al.</em> 2008), as well as their capacity to be easily collected using
  the point-intercept method (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). The latter allows the <em>Fire</em> module to be
  undertaken simultaneously with the <em><a

          >Condition</a

  to the respective cover or condition data at each point-intercept. The
  <em>Fire</em> module needs to be undertaken as part of the

          >Condition</a
        ></em> module as fire affects the function, composition and
  structure of biodiversity.
</p>
<p>
  Maximum trunk char height is measured from four sampling locations within the
  plot, where the four point-intercept transects intersect. This is an important
  indicator of fire severity (Chafer 2008; Keeley 2009; Edwards
  <em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015), which is unlikely to be
  sampled adequately using the point-intercept method due to the vertical
  orientation of tree trunks. Furthermore, trunk char height may be used as a
  surrogate for flame height and is thus a potential post-fire indicator of fire
  intensity (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003).
</p>
<p>
  Soil char depth is an indicator of fire severity and its impact on soil
  properties and processes (Marcos <em>et al.</em> 2018). It can be used to
  infer the degree of soil heating during fire, which effects the pre-fire water
  repellency properties of soil and associated erosion risk (Doerr
  <em>et al.</em> 2004; Doerr <em>et al.</em> 2006; Shakesby
  <em>et al.</em> 2007; Chafer 2008; Badía-Villas <em>et al.</em> 2014). Changes
  in other soil properties, including soil organic carbon and aggregate size
  distribution and stability, which are indicative of soil structure and its
  ability to resist degradation, can also be inferred from soil char depth
  (Badía-Villas <em>et al.</em> 2014; Marcos <em>et al.</em> 2018), with soil
  char depth being the best visual indicator to show changes in soil properties
  in large fire that occur in Mediterranean pine forests (Marcos
  <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Collecting quantitative field measurements of fire severity attributes using
  the point-intercept method also provides objective, repeatable and precise
  measures to calibrate and validate remotely sensed fire severity products
  (Cocke <em>et al.</em> 2005; Chafer 2008; Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013),
  including those collected from UAVs (McKenna <em>et al.</em> 2017; Hillman
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Although remote sensing assessments of fire severity
  are internally consistent and repeatable, they cannot reliably detect
  low-severity fires where forest canopies are left un-scorched. It is therefore
  critical to monitor fire severity in a standardised, repeatable manner to
  collect spatially and temporally consistent data for calibration and
  validation (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Time since fire is recorded based on on-ground knowledge and/or available
  datasets. The time since fire that a survey is undertaken influences the
  ecological character of fire severity through first-order effects, including
  delayed survivorship and mortality. Survivorship can diminish measures of fire
  severity as burned vegetation remains viable and regenerates. For this reason,
  the cover of regenerating vegetation is also recorded. Conversely, delayed
  mortality can inflate fire severity measures when apparently healthy
  vegetation is in fact damaged by heat to the extent that it dies over time
  (Key 2006). For these reasons, temporal information accompanying the fire
  severity measures is recorded to ensure the correct interpretation and
  comparison of the data.

  The <em>Fire</em> module involves the collection of quantitative, accurate and
  repeatable measures of fire severity using the point-intercept method
  (described in detail in the <em><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b"
          >Cover</a
        ></em>
  module), as well as measurements of trunk char height and soil char depth.
  Fire severity is defined as the degree of consumption and scorching of live
  vegetation and dead fuel, and the degree to which soil properties and
  processes are altered, as a result of combustion (Smith
  <em>et al.</em> 2005; Hammill and Bradstock 2006).
</p>
<p>
  The effects of fire severity are directly measured which allows them to be
  integrated into fire severity indices specifically designed for objective fire
  severity monitoring and mapping (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013; Morgan
  <em>et al.</em> 2014). This includes in the calibration and validation of
  broad-scale remote sensing derived fire severity indices (Hammill and
  Bradstock 2006), and in calculations to determine fire intensity (Whight and
  Bradstock 1999; Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004).
</p>
<p>
  Fire severity is quantified horizontally and vertically within the plot
  through the following attributes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cover and height of vegetation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover and height of charred and scorched vegetation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover and height of regenerating vegetation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover of litter and coarse woody debris (CWD)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover of charred litter and CWD</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover of scorch litter (i.e. scorch leaf fall)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover of bare and charred soil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cover of white and black ash</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trunk char height (in wooded systems)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soil char depth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The cover measurements are indicative of fire extent and patchiness (Edwards
  <em>et al.</em> 2013), while the height measurements provide insight into the
  degree of charring and scorching of the vegetation in each stratum, which are
  key indicators of fire severity (Whight and Bradstock 1999; Hammill and
  Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008; Edwards
  <em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). Soil char depth is a
  visual indicator that is measured to evaluate fire severity with respect to
  changes in soil properties and processes (Marcos <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Time since fire is also recorded based on on-ground knowledge and/or available
  datasets (e.g. interactive online natural resources GIS datasets) to ensure
  the correct interpretation and comparison of the data.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Fire</em> module is tailored to monitor fire severity in burnt areas,
  including areas subject to controlled burns. Therefore, it does not include
  the collection of fuel load and ecosystem response data. However, fuel load
  and arrangement can be monitored with data collected in the
