<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done concurrently, or
      immediately after the <em>Cover</em> point-intercept to take advantage of
      the transect lines already laid. These transects can be used to divide the
      plot into smaller areas and assist with the systematic survey of the area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The plot should be traversed and CWD abundance assessed before the survey
      design is selected. This can be undertaken while traversing the plot
      during the <em>Floristics</em> and <em>Cover</em> modules.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that users take note of the amount of CWD that
      intersects the point-intercept transects when undertaking the
      <em>Cover</em> module, to help inform the survey design and increase
      efficiency in the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The results from the point intercept can give an indication of the most
      suitable CWD design to use, but it is likely that not all pieces of CWD
      that intersect the transect will be recorded during the point-intercept
      survey, so should be used in combination with a quick site assessment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      CWD can be patchily distributed, so assess multiple transects before
      making a decision about the use of transects of plot sampling. If ≤ 5
      pieces of CWD on average intersect a 100 m transect, then plots should be
      used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For areas with high abundance of CWD or clustered CWD, mark (survey pin,
      flagging tape, paint) CWD that has been measured to avoid duplicate
      measures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If decay status varies along the piece of CWD, record the most dominant
      decay class.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure CWD diameter at the widest and narrowest end that are within the
      plot. Do not measure any part of the CWD that falls outside of the plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measurements of length are made to the plot border, regardless of whether
      the tree is rooted inside or outside of the plot (Baker and Chao 2011).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CWD diameter is recorded in cm and length is recorded in m.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the size
      threshold and is within the plot boundary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A cased tape measure is recommended for recording CWD lengths, as they are
      compact and easily retractable.
