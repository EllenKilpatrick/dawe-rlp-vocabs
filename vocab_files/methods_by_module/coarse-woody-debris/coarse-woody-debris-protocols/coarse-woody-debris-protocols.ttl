<ul>
<li><p>If the average diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees in the
study system is between 5-15 cm (can use measurements from the
Recruitment or Basal Area Modules) then use 5 cm cut-off for CWD.
Generally, this will only occur in some mallee and mulga communities or
as a consequence of intervention in an area (e.g. clear-felling or
regeneration planting project).</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done
concurrently, or immediately after the Cover Module point-intercept
survey to take advantage of the transect lines already laid. These
transects can be used to divide the plot into smaller areas and assist
with the systematic survey of the area.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not measure any part of the CWD that falls outside of the plot
(<a href="appendices">Appendix 1</a>.).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</p></li>
<li><p>Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the
size threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>Four 100 m tape measures are recommended for defining the plot
boundary. Additional tapes can be used to divide the plot into smaller
units to assist with the systematic survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measures with metrics on both sides are
recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Observer should stand at the centre point of CWD when recording
location with the app.</p></li>
<li><p>When measuring a piece of CWD where the roots are attached, do
not record the largest diameter at the roots (<mark></mark><a href="appendices">Appendix
1</a>.).</p></li>
<li><p>CWD is only measured when it is in contact with the ground. CWD
is not measured when suspended in the air with the support of other
trees because pieces suspended off the ground are considered partially
downed trees (<a href="appendices">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>

where their diameter is equal or greater than 10 cm (or 5 cm), these cut

<p>Circled in blue above is a piece of CWD that is partially off the
ground. Here you would record the piece of CWD as two sections, the two
ends that are in contact with the ground, and you would not record the
middle of the piece which is off the ground. The partially downed tree
circled in red would not be recorded. It is suspended in the air
completely by another tree.</p>

    Prior to implementing the Coarse Woody Debris protocols, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot and sub-plot boundary and to define the current plot
and visit in the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The survey area is determined by the protocol being
undertaken:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If completing the Standard protocol use the transects laid out
for the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a> or <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition</a> Modules to delineate the 40 x 40 m sub-plot
survey area between the N/S2 and N/S4, and E/W2 and E/W4 point-intercept
transects; see Figure 1 for plot layout. This 40 x 40 m subplot will be
the survey area.</p></li>

<p>Figure 1. Plot layouts for the 100 x 100 m core plot 40 x 40 m
sub-plot</p>
<li><p>If completing the Enhanced
protocol, the 100 x 100 m plot will be the survey area; see Figure 1 for
plot layout. If the Coarse Woody Debris Module is undertaken after the
Cover Module the point intercept grid can be used to delineate the plot
boundary and divide the plot up to assist with the systematic survey.
Alternatively, use coloured survey pins.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Open the app and navigate to the Coarse Woody Debris Module and
select the protocol relevant to your project. Steps 4 - 19 are the same
whether completing the Enhanced or Standard protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the GNSS device is connected and has a high level of
accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify if a <em>10 cm</em> diameter (default) or <em>5 cm</em>
diameter (woodland and mallee systems) threshold is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify if a <em>50 cm</em> (default) or <em>30 cm</em> length
threshold is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Systematically search the plot, utilising the sub-divisions for
any CWD ≥50 cm in length (or ≥30 cm for eligible systems) that occurs
within the area. Measure all eligible CWD encountered. A CWD piece is
eligible if it is ≥50 cm in length and ≥10 cm diameter (or ≥5 cm for
eligible systems) at any point along its length. Partially downed trees
(PDT), tree stumps and residue piles will not be recorded during the
survey because they are not considered CWD. To record stumps, refer to
the Condition Module.</p></li>
<li><p>To measure CWD that is encountered, stand at its mid-point and
select <em>add CWD</em>. The location of the CWD is automatically
recorded and can be updated if required (Appendix 1.).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure and record the diameter at the widest point in cm
(D<sub>1</sub>).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure and record the diameter at the narrowest point
(D<sub>2</sub>), to a minimum diameter of 10 cm (or 5 cm where
appropriate).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure and record the length (in metres) for the portion of the
CWD that is greater than 10 cm (or 5 cm) in diameter. Refer to
<mark></mark>Appendix 1.for more information about measuring CWD
diameter and length.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a piece of CWD is irregular in shape, it may be divided
into multiple smaller roughly linear and cylindrical sections for ease
of measurement (Appendix 1.). Select <em>Add section</em> to add
sections where necessary.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Each eligible section will be considered a subsidiary of the
first section recorded (i.e. the first section will be CWD 1a and each
section that follows will be recorded as 1b; 1c; 1d; etc.). Record
D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> and length for each eligible
section.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Where a piece of CWD is partially off the ground, only record the
sections that are in contact with the ground and eligible (Appendix 2).
Select <em>add section</em> to add sections where necessary.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Each eligible section will be considered a subsidiary of the
first section recorded (i.e. the first section will be CWD 1a and each
section that follows will be recorded as 1b; 1c; 1d; etc.). Record
D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and length for each eligible
section.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Assign the decay class that best describes the CWD (ignoring
sections that are ineligible). Refer to Table 2 and Appendix 3. for
examples of each class. If the level of decay varies along the piece of
CWD, record the most dominant decay class (the decay class that best
describes the entire piece of CWD).</p></li>
<li><p>Record if the piece of CWD is hollow using the
check-box.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally take a photograph of the piece of CWD.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the comments tab for any additional remarks (e.g. proportion
not in contact with ground).</p></li>
<li><p>For areas with a high abundance of CWD or clustered CWD mark
(survey pin, flagging tape, chalk) CWD that has been measured to avoid
duplicate measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 8-18 for each eligible piece of CWD within the
plot.</p></li>
