<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two main protocols for
  recording CWD within the plot. Each protocol has two options, depending on CWD
  abundance.:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>Transects</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>6 transects</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>4 transects</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plots</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>50 x 50 m plot</p>
      </li>

</p>

<p>
  The <em>Coarse Woody Debris</em> module is linked to the following modules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition</a></em>
      – CWD must be collected as part of the condition module. Finer woody
      debris and litter cover are collected as part of the condition
      point-intercept.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a></em>
      – The CWD transect sampling methods use a subset of the point-intercept
      transects set up for the <em>Cover</em> module. It is recommended that CWD
      surveys be undertaken after the <em>Cover</em> module. CWD hits are
      recorded as part of the point-intercept survey and percent cover of CWD
      can be calculated using these results.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="survey-type-selection">Survey type selection</h3>
<p>
  Option 1a with 6 transects is the preferred method, but variations are
  provided on this design, depending on the abundance and distribution of CWD
  within the plot. If CWD is abundant at the site and collecting from all 6
  transects will be time consuming (&gt;60 CWD pieces sampled) and add little
  extra information, CWD data can be collected across 4 transects, if on
  average, 11 or more pieces of CWD are intersected per 100 m transect.
</p>
<p>
  If CWD is in low abundance then plot based sampling should be used. A 50 x
  50 m plot is the preferred option in this case and should be used if at least
  36-40 pieces of CWD occur within the 50 x 50 m area. If ≤ 40 pieces of CWD are
  present across the entire 1 ha plot, then the 100 x 100 m area should be
  selected.

<p>Figure 3. CWD survey options decision framework</p>
<h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and procedures</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if the 10 cm diameter threshold is appropriate for the system
      under study, by undertaking a quick assessment of tree size (trunk
      diameter) and CWD size (this will generally only be required in some
      woodland and mallee woodland systems. As a standard, 10 cm should be used
      for forests).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Undertake a quick assessment of the site to get an understanding of the
      amount of CWD present (this can be undertaken at the same time as the
      point intercept transects).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The number of CWD hits from the point-intercept can also give an
      indication to the most appropriate design.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Work through the decision framework above to determine the most
      appropriate survey option for the system under study.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Based on the results from Step 4, proceed to either ‘<a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/fc74b2cb-f3ab-4101-9e3f-43f016db3db6">Transects protocol</a>’ or ‘<a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/7d50794a-8784-4ab9-99ff-a324bb6e0831">Plots protocol</a>’ to commence the field survey.

<p>
  Coarse woody debris contributes to a range of ecosystem processes, including
  nutrient cycling and storage, soil formation, stability, and retention,
  retaining moisture and enhancing water infiltration, improving thermal
  conditions, and providing sites for litter accumulation (Goldin 2020; Grove
  and Meggs 2003; Manning et al. 2013; Woldendorp et al. 2004). CWD can also
  influence fuel loads and fire dynamics (Miehs et al. 2010), and is a preferred
  habitat feature for a range of fauna, including shelter, nesting and denning
  sites for a variety of mammals, reptiles and some birds (Mac Nally et al.
  2001; Threlfall et al. 2021). Decaying CWD provides substrates and nutrients
  for invertebrates and fungi and can also create sites for seedling
  establishment (Grove and Meggs 2003; Woldendorp et al. 2002b). However,
  despite its importance in a range of systems, CWD is often difficult to study
  because of its patchy distribution, and this can be especially problematic in
  woodland ecosystems, where it is relatively scarce, unevenly distributed and
  smaller in size than other forest types (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010).
</p>
<p>
  A range of different methods have been used to capture information on CWD,
  including various transect, strip plot and quadrat designs (e.g. (Aponte
  <em>et al.</em> 2014; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015; Kanowski
  <em>et al.</em> 2003; Michaels 2006; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010; Threlfall
  <em>et al.</em> 2021; Whitford <em>et al.</em> 2011; Woldendorp
  <em>et al.</em> 2002a). Transect (line intercept) and plots are the most
  commonly used techniques to sample CWD (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2000; Miehs
  <em>et al.</em> 2010), however, no consistent sampling method has been adopted
  across the board, because of the structural differences between woody systems
  (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004). Consequently,
  different sampling designs have been developed as part of the
  <em>Coarse Woody Debris</em> module, consisting of transect and plot-based
  methods, with standardised data (dimensions, decay class) collected using
  these different sampling techniques and standardised outputs possible (e.g.
  CWD volume per ha). Transects are the default sampling option because they
  tend to be more efficient, but in systems with low CWD abundance, plots are
  recommended.
</p>
<p>
  Ensuring adequate amounts of CWD are measured is one of the main
  considerations when designing surveys (Grove 2001). The total length of
  transects established over an area tends to be more important than how many
  individual line transects contribute to that length (Marshall
  <em>et al.</em> 2000). Generally, at least 500 m of transects are needed to
  get an acceptable level of precision in woodland systems (Miehs
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Whitford <em>et al.</em> 2011), whereas shorter/fewer
  transects can be effective in forest ecosystems (Aponte <em>et al.</em> 2014;
  Fraver <em>et al.</em> 2018; Kanowski <em>et al.</em> 2003; Woldendorp
  <em>et al.</em> 2004). In areas with high CWD abundance (11 or more intersects
  per 100 m transect), the line intersect method is generally efficient and
  precise (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2004), but when CWD is relatively low in
  abundance (5 or less intersects per 100 m) then plot based methods tend to be
  more effective (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2004; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002b).
  It is recommended that all CWD are measured when there are less than 40 pieces
  within a 50 x 50 m area (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004).
</p>
<p>
  Non-random orientation of CWD can occur due to wind throw, flooding,
  topography and harvesting practices and this can influence the estimates of
  CWD abundance, depending on transect orientation and layout (Woldendorp
  <em>et al.</em> 2004). By sampling along transect lines laid in different
  directions, the number of CWD that intersect the lines can be assumed to be
  unbiased and unrelated to their orientation or position on a slope (Waddell
  2002). Transects should be spaced ≥ 20 m apart to maintain independence (Baker
  and Chao 2011), and if a piece of CWD intersects more than one transect, it
  should only be measured once. Consequently, the transect designs presented
  here include transects laid in two directions, with spacing of ≥ 20 m.
</p>
<p>
  A design with 6 x 100 m transects is the recommended approach, but the
  sampling method adopted should be selected based on the abundance and size of
  the CWD present, with variations on this design provided for systems with both
  a high and low abundance of CWD. Transects align with a subset of the
  point-intercept transects used in the <em>Cover</em> Module, with 6 or 4
  transects options available, and transects orientated in north-south and
  east-west directions to ensure unbiased sampling. In systems with a high
  abundance of CWD (11 or more intersects per 100 m), the 4 transect option can
  be used, whereas the 6 transect option is suitable when 6-10 pieces are
  intersected per transect. In systems with low CWD abundance, plot-based
  methods have been developed with sampling options including a 50 x 50 m
  subplot or the entire 100 m x 100 m plot.
</p>
<p>
  For the purposes of this module, CWD has been defined as any pieces of downed
  woody material with a diameter of 10 cm or greater, as this the most commonly
  used size threshold across studies (Baker and Chao 2011; Meggs 1996; Whitford
  and McCaw 2019; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004; Woldendorp and Keenan 2005).
  However, 5 cm is a more appropriate cut-off in some systems such as woodlands
  or mallee woodlands, where trees are generally smaller, so the option exists
  to reduce the diameter cut-off to 5 cm (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010). A 5 cm
  cut-off should only be applied when the guidelines set out in the supporting
  information of this document are met.. In all other situations, 10 cm should
  be used. Litter and finer woody debris (&lt;10 cm diameter) cover can be
  recorded as part of the <em>Cover</em> and <em>Condition</em> Modules.
</p>
<p>
  The length and diameter (at both ends) is measured for every piece of CWD
  encountered that meets the size thresholds. For CWD tapering to less than
  10 cm diameter (or 5 cm in applicable systems), measurements are made only up
  to the point where the log tapers to less than 10 cm diameter (Baker and Chao
  2011). Taking a measurement at either end (rather than a mid-point or point of
  intersection with a transect) can substantially reduce or eliminate bias and
  produce more accurate volume estimates (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2009). Allocating
  a decay class based on the structural integrity of the wood assists with
  biomass estimation and provides an indication of the ecosystem processes
  occurring (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a).
  The location of the CWD within the plot is also recorded because the
  distrubtion of CWD can influence abundance and volume estimates, but the
  spatial distribution of CWD is rarely assessed as part of these measures
  (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010), and as such, location information can help
  improve the understanding of CWD and its distribution between different sites
  and systems.
</p>
<p>
  The length and volume of CWD per hectare can be calculated using both
  transects and plot based methods (see the
  <em>Analysis and Calculations</em> section). If plots are used, abundance and
  volume can be easily scaled up (if 50 m x 50 m plot used) to a per hectare
  value or calculated directly if the 100 x 100 m plot is used. Widely used
  equations are available to convert the abundance or volume of CWD recorded
  along transects to per hectare measures (Baker and Chao 2011; Miehs
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Waddell 2002). Refer to Section 6 Analysis and
  calculations for more information.

    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Coarse Woody Debris</em> module provides procedures and guidelines for
  recording coarse woody debris (CWD) abundance, dimension and level of decay,
  using transects or plots, depending on the system under study and the project
  requirements. These measures can be used in sites that contain woody
  vegetation to get an estimate of the length and volume of CWD present.
</p>
<p>
  Coarse woody debris is fallen dead wood that is a key structural and habitat
  component of many ecosystems and linked to a range of biodiversity and
  ecosystem processes (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2000; Woldendorp and Keenan
  2005). For the purpose of this module, CWD is defined as any fallen trees or
  branches with a diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm (Baker and Chao 2011;
  Goldin 2020), but the way in which CWD is defined and measured varies between
  studies (Grove 2001; Jones <em>et al.</em> 2020; Woldendorp
  <em>et al.</em> 2004; Woldendorp and Keenan 2005). In some systems, such as
  woodlands and mallee woodlands where trunk diameters are smaller, a diameter
  of greater than or equal to 5 cm can be used (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010).
</p>
<p>
  Coarse woody debris can take decades to centuries to accumulate, especially
  for large pieces, and is influenced by tree species and age, stand structure,
  productivity, disturbance, physical environment and wood decay rate (Manning
  <em>et al.</em> 2013; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a). CWD is typical of
  natural woodland or forest communities, but it has declined or been lost from
  many ecosystems around the world as a result of vegetation clearing, logging
  and grazing which reduce the structural diversity of stands (Manning
  <em>et al.</em> 2013). CWD abundance is assessed for a range of purposes,
  including stand structural assessments, as an indicator of habitat value for
  ground-dwelling fauna, carbon biomass and fuel load estimates, condition
  assessments and as an indicator of management or disturbance intensity (Eyre
  <em>et al.</em> 2015; Grove 2001).
</p>
<p>
  Accurate estimation of CWD is critical for the effective management of forest
  and woodland systems (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2004), and sampling can provide an
  estimate of the abundance, cover, volume, length and level of decay of fallen
  woody material in an ecosystem (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2009). All branching
  parts and broken pieces are measured separately, if they meet the size
  threshold (Threlfall <em>et al.</em> 2021). When CWD is irregular or
  non-uniform in shape, it is divided into multiple smaller sections for
  measurement, and each section should be approximately linear and cylindrical
  in shape (Figure 1). In addition, physical and biological processes begin to
  degrade fallen woody material through fragmentation and decomposition
  (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a), so CWD is often assigned a decay class,
  ranging from recently fallen to largely disintegrated (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2016; Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015). The level of decay can
  give an indication of return of nutrients to the soil, contributes to the
  process of soil development, and a range of decay classes can provide habitat
  for fungi, plants and invertebrates (Meggs 1996).
