    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done concurrently, or
      immediately after the <em>Cover</em> module to take advantage of the
      point-intercept transects already laid. The CWD transects are a sub-set of
      those set up for the cover point-intercept.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The plot should be traversed and CWD abundance assessed before the survey
      design is selected. This can be undertaken while traversing the plot
      during the <em>Floristics</em> and <em>Cover</em> modules.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that users take note of the amount of CWD that
      intersects the point-intercept transects when undertaking the
      <em>Cover</em> module, to help inform the survey design and increase
      efficiency in the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The results from the point-intercept can also give an indication of the
      most suitable CWD design to use (i.e. number of hits along a transect can
      indicate if 4 or 6 transects are suitable or if a plot-based method is
      required). Results from the point-intercept survey should be used in
      combination with knowledge of the site to determine the most appropriate
      method, as not all CWD intersects will be recorded during the
      point-intercept survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      CWD can be patchily distributed, so assess multiple transects before
      making a decision about the appropriate number of transects to use. On
      average, 6-10 pieces should be intersected per 100 m transect for the 6
      transect option and ≥11 pieces per 100 m transect for the 4 transect
      option.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the 4 transect option is selected but not enough pieces of CWD are
      intersected using this method, a warning message will appear. In this
      case, it is possible to add additional transects, to allow data to be
      collected from the NS and EW 50 m transects as well.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If decay status varies along the piece of CWD, record the most dominant
      decay class, and not the class at the point of intersection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a piece of CWD intersects multiple transects, it should only be
      measured once.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a piece of CWD intersects more than one transect, or for areas with
      high abundance of CWD or clustered CWD, mark (survey pin, flagging tape,
      paint) CWD that has been measured to avoid duplicate measures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure CWD diameter at the widest and narrowest end and not the diameter
      that intersects the tape.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CWD diameter is recorded in cm and length is recorded in m.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the size
      threshold and is within the plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A cased tape measure is recommended for recording CWD lengths, as they are
      compact and easily retractable.
