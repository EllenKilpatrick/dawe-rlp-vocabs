      The camera traps should have been prepared and calibrated prior to the
      field survey. If this has not been done, refer to the Camera trap
      preparation and calibration section to install batteries, SD cards and
      desiccant packets (for humid/wet conditions), and configure the settings
      for each camera trap before continuing.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      As you traverse your project area and locate a feature of interest,
      approach it with the required equipment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the ‘Camera traps’ module and then the ‘Targeted protocol’ in the
      App. The App will automatically record a <em>Survey ID</em> and
      <em>Survey name</em> (e.g. Project C – Camera trap deployment), as well as
      the <em>Protocol name</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the ‘Camera trap deployment’ button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Scan the immediate area the ensure it is suitable to secure a camera trap
      mounting post with the feature of interest or bait station post in a
      southerly direction (if using bait stations). If the immediate area is not
      suitable to secure the posts (e.g. rocky, dense vegetation), move to the
      nearest suitable area and press the ‘Add camera trap point’ button to
      record the position of and establish a camera trap point in the App using
      the Trimble® R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If targeting a specific species or taxa, record the
      <em>Target species</em> from the drop-down list (Tip: start typing the
      species or taxa and record the relevant data using predictive text).
      Multiple species can be added.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Feature</em> (e.g. water point, tree hollow, bait station)
      from the drop-down list or manual entry.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If using a bait station, install this first so you have a focal point when
      setting up the camera trap. Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to
      secure a mounting post into the ground. Ensure the post remains tall
      enough so the bait container is a suitable height above the ground for
      your project needs. Ensure the post is secure enough that it cannot be
      easily knocked over by animals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If using a bait station, secure the bait container to the post using a
      mounting apparatus. Record the <em>Bait container height</em> in
      centimeters. Where ants may be a problem, spread dust or granular
      insecticide for ants around the base of the bait station. Record the
      <em>Lure type</em> and <em>Lure variety</em> used from the drop-down list
      or maunal entry.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a camera trap mounting
      post into the ground in a northerly direction from your focal point.
      Ensure the post remains tall enough so the top of the mounted camera trap
      is a suitable height for your project needs. If there is a large tree
      trunk or stem in a suitable position this can be used. Record the
      <em>Camera trap height</em>. Ensure the post is secure or the tree trunk
      or stem is large enough to prevent false triggers from camera movement.
      Record the <em>Camera trap mount</em> as from the drop-down list (e.g.
      ‘Star dropper’, ‘Tree’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Distance to feature</em> and <em>Direction to feature</em>,
      using the compass on your device, or a compass.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Detection angle</em>, the angle of incidence relative to
      the feature (e.g. animal path).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap point is located on sloped ground, record the
      <em>Slope</em> and <em>Aspect</em> using the inclinometer and compass on
      your device, or an inclinometer and compass. See Camera trap deployment
      for guidelines to set camera traps on sloped ground. If the area is flat
      leave the default <em>Slope</em> (‘0°’) and <em>Aspect</em> (‘n/a’)
      values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before mounting the camera trap, open the unit and check and record the
      <em>Camera trap number</em> and <em>SD card number</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap make</em>, <em>Camera trap model</em>,
      <em>Camera trap year</em> (same model may vary between years),
      <em>Illumination</em>, <em>Activation mechanism</em> (i.e. ‘PIR’) and
      <em>Trigger speed</em> in seconds. Once the data is entered for the first
      camera trap you configure, your previous selections will automatically
      appear for each subsquent camera trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap settings</em> from step 17. Once the data is
      entered for the first camera trap you configure, your previous selections
      will automatically appear for each subsquent camera trap. You will just
      need to update the <em>Camera trap number</em> and
      <em>SD card number</em> in the App, and <em>User label</em> in the camera
      trap and in the App. Close the camera trap.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Using a mounting apparatus, mount the camera trap so that it is at a
      height to suit your project needs and facing the focal point or bait
      station. It should be facing south whereever possible (otherwise in a
      southery direction). Record the <em>Camera trap height</em> in
      centimeters. Record the <em>Camera trap direction</em> relative to north
      (0–359°) using the compass on your mobile device, or a compass.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="20" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Use chocks or woody debris from within the plot to angle the camera so it
      captures the feature or the base of the bait station in the middle of the
      frame. Record the <em>Camera trap angle</em> using a protractor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required for your project, use an angle bracket to orientate the camera
      trap horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view)
      to survey small mammals and reptiles (e.g. Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019;
      Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020b). Record the <em>Camera trap angle</em> as
      ‘90°’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required for your project, install drift fences to direct species
      towards the detection zone, and/or cork tiles to create a sufficient
      thermal contrast between the tile, which is heated by the sun, and the
      species. Record these as <em>Additional equipement</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash unit or
      camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging tape).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required, undertake site preparation to prevent false triggers,
      maximise species identification and reduce fire risk to equipment. Clear
      all vegetation (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks, leaves, etc.)
      between the camera and feature or bait station. Clear vegetation at least
      1 m behind the feature or bait station and at least 1 m around the camera
      trap (to mitigate fire damage). Consider the field of view of the sensor
      and clear vegetation at least 1.5 m either side of the feature or bait
      station.

      If the camera trap is missing, search the vicinity as it may have been
      dislodged and shifted by fauna. If you cannot find the camera trap, you
      will record it as ‘Missing’ in step 8.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select the ‘Camera traps’ module and then the ‘Array protocol’ in the App.
      The App will automatically record a <em>Survey ID</em> and
      <em>Survey name</em> (e.g. Project C – Camera trap redeployment), as well
      as the <em>Protocol name</em>.
    </p>

      Record the <em>Operational status</em> from the drop-down list
      (‘Operational’, ‘SD card full’, ‘Batteries flat’, ‘Not operational’,
      ‘Missing’). Turn the camera trap ‘ON’ and navigate to the ‘CHECK STATUS’
      function. The number of images captured, amount of space on the SD card
      and amount of battery power remaining will be displayed. Record the
      <em>Number of images</em>. If the display is blank, the batteries may be
      flat. Replace the batteries and switch the camera trap ‘ON’ to determine
      if the camera trap was not operational due to flat batteries or being
      damaged.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch ‘OFF’ and close the camera trap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace the batteries, SD card and desiccant packet (for humid/wet

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap is not operational or missing, replace the camera trap
      and record the <em>Camera trap number</em>, <em>Battery type</em> and
      <em>SD card number</em>. If the camera trap is missing consider the
      security risk and whether redeployment is worthwhile.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap make</em>, <em>Camera trap model</em>,
      <em>Camera trap year</em> (same model may vary between years),
      <em>Illumination</em>, <em>Activation mechanism</em> (i.e. ‘PIR’) and
      <em>Trigger speed</em> in seconds. Once the data is entered for the first

      Record the <em>Redeployment camera trap settings</em> from step 13. Once
      the data is entered for the first camera trap you configure, your previous
      selections will automatically appear for each subsquent camera trap. You
      will just need to update the <em>User label</em> in the camera trap and in

  <li>
    <p>
      Record the media type as from the drop-down list (i.e. ‘Image’, Burst’,
      ‘Time lapse’, ‘Video’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace any mounting posts that are missing (record this in
      <em>Redeployment observations</em>). Use a steel post driver or mash
      hammer to secure a camera trap mounting post into the ground. Ensure the
      post remains tall enough so the top of the mounted camera trap is a
      suitable height for your project needs. If there is a large tree trunk or
      stem in a suitable position this can be used. Record the
      <em>Camera trap height</em>. Ensure the post is secure or the tree trunk
      or stem is large enough to prevent false triggers from camera movement.
      Record the <em>Camera trap mount</em> as from the drop-down list (e.g.
      ‘Star dropper’, ‘Tree’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there is a bait station, replace the bait in the bait container.
      Replace the bait container if it is missing (record this in
      <em>Redeployment observations</em>). Where ants may be a problem, spread
      dust or granular insecticide for ants around the base of the bait station.
      Record the <em>Lure type</em> and <em>Lure variety</em> used from the
      drop-down list or maunal entry. Record the <em>Bait container height</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using a mounting apparatus, mount the camera trap so that it is at a
      height to suit your project needs and facing the feature or bait station.
      It should be facing south whereever possible (otherwise in a southery
      direction). Record the <em>Camera trap height</em> in centimeters. Record
      the <em>Camera trap direction</em> relative to north (0–359°) using the
      compass on your mobile device, or a compass.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use chocks or woody debris from within the plot to angle the camera so it
      captures the feature or the base of the bait station in the middle of the
      frame. Record the <em>Camera trap angle</em> using a protractor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required for your project, use an angle bracket to orientate the camera
      trap horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view)
      to survey small mammals and reptiles (e.g. Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019;
      Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020b). Record the <em>Camera trap angle</em> as
      ‘90°’.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash unit or
      camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging tape).

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required, undertake site preparation to prevent false triggers,
      maximise species detection and identification, and reduce fire risk to
      equipment. Clear vegetation (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks,
      leaves, etc.) between the camera and focal point, and at least 1 m around
      the camera trap (to mitigate fire damage). However, try to minimise
      disturbance and keep the focal point as natural as possible to prevent
      influencing the behavoiur of fauna.

      Test if the camera trap is positioned correctly using one of the following
      methods:
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Walk test (if available):</strong> open the camera trap. Switch it
      to the ‘ON’ position and navigate to the ‘WALK TEST’ function. Close the
      camera trap. Test the field of view by moving your hand around the focal
      point or bait station, while watching for the red light on the camera trap
      to indicate when are within the field of view. Adjust the camera trap and
      repeat the exercise as necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Hand-held digital camera:</strong> open the camera trap. Switch it
      to the ‘ON’ position and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap.
      Trigger the camera trap by moving your hand around the focal point or bait
      station. Switch off the camera trap, remove the SD card and view the
      images using a hand-held digital camera. Delete the images before
      re-inserting the SD card in the camera trap. Adjust the camera trap and
      repeat the exercise as necessary.

      If required, replace the flagging tape in a nearby tree to mark the
      location for easy camera trap recovery or redeployment. Ensure the
      flagging tape is not in the field of view of the camera trap. If there is
      a security risk, the camera trap can be located using the App.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>
  The following points are adapted from Gillespie <em>et al.</em> (2015), Molloy
  (2018) and TEAM Network (2011b).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Traversing the project area</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Disturbance of the project area should be minimised by using existing
      tracks and trails or establishing temporary access routes that can be used
      simultaneously to undertake multiple modules.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some camera trap points may need to be traversed to on foot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Camera trap deployment</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Look for features of interests, where fauna activity is likely to be high
      (e.g. water points, trail intersections).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Look for signs of animal paths, or natural openings through the area, such
      as adjacent to rock ledges or creek beds; also place camera traps in areas
      with contrasting vegetation structures, such as densely vegetated versus
      open areas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Opportunistic observations may also give an indication of areas that could
      be targeted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid deploying camera traps in areas where there is a risk of inundation
      during the deployment period.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Deploy camera traps so that they are facing south to prevent glare and sun
      damage to the camera lens and sensor. Avoid deploying with east and
      west-facing orientations to reduce false triggers from the rising and
      setting of the sun.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      There is evidence of overheating and mulfunction of camera trap batteries
      on days where daytime temperatures exceed 40<sup>o</sup>C. Depending on
      the location and time of year, shade may need to be provided to protect
      the back of the camera trap from sun expopsure (Dundas
      <em>et al.</em> 2019).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible, try to deploy camera traps so they are on an angle relative
      to animal paths.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In sloped terrain, camera traps should be angled and parallel to the
      ground to ensure detection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level camera trap points are preferable as they provide undistorted and
      unobstructed view of subjects, particularly smaller animals. Downward
      slopes increase the size of blind zones (although this can be partially
      rectified by angling the camera trap downward) and upward slopes reduce
      the photographed area and proved a greater opportunity for concealment by
      increasing the effect of on ground structures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to the relevant camera trap make and model user manuals for guidance
      in the operation and functionality of the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that the housing of each camera trap is properly closed to prevent
      moisture damaging the electronics.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All camera traps used in a survey should all be set up with the same
      settings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Theft and vandalism inevitably occur. Consider the risk of this in your
      project area and use anit-theft devices. Cable-locking camera traps or
      using security boxes will act as a deterrent and is advisable in areas
      with high human visitation or if setting camera traps along vehicle or
      walking tracks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When multiple camera traps are deployed it is advisable to use combination
      locks, or have locks keyed-alike, to avoid having to carry multiple keys
      into the field. Coil excess cable length up off the ground.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      in many cases, people who discover cameras may not disturb them, but will
      be curious about why they are there. Attaching a small sign to the side of
      each camera with a brief description of the project and some contact
      information is likely to satisfy curiosity and may help to limit vandalism
      or other interference.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Minimise animal interference of camera traps by securing them tightly,
      securing the door with a cable tie, or placing the camera trap inside a
      metal security box. Reconyx manufacture sturdy metal cases for their
      cameras for additional protection if needed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Site preparation</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Careful site clearing is important to minimise false triggers, maximise
      identification of animals and reduce fire risk to equipment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine what vegetation may cause false triggers, such as overhanging
      branches, or plants nearby that may grow into the sensor field during
      deployment, and remove with secateurs or rake as necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If deployment will extend over a growing period, dig out perennial grass
      and shrub bases of the cleared area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid piling cleared material right next to the camera trap point as this
      may just blow across the field of vision, triggering false images, or
      impede animal access.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If in doubt regarding vegetation clearing, set the camera trap and trigger
      it to take a couple of photos, then remove the SD card and put it into a
      hand-held digital camera to check field of view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try to minimise disturbance and keep the focal point as natural as
      possible to prevent influencing the behaviour of fauna.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Recovering camera traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is important to confirm whether or not the camera trap was operational
      for the whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence on recovery
      of the camera trap it makes it impossible to know whether it was
      operational for the full deployment period. For example, if the last image
      occurs in week 3 of 4, this could reflect either no animals at the camera
      trap point post week 3 or a camera malfunction sometime post this time.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      If the SD card was full, it is recommended that the SD card is replaced
      with one with greater storage capacity, or checking the SD card storage at
      a shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the batteries were flat, it is recommended that they be checked at a
      shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider if the site preparation might have caused false triggers and
      undertaken more clearance if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap was stolen or vandalised, consider the risk of this
      happening again and if anti-theft devices and measures will be enough to
      prevent this.
