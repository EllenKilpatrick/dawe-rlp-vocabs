    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
    <p>
  The <em>Camera traps</em> module covers three camera trapping protocols that
  can be undertaken depending on the purpose of your project:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Fauna plot protocol – standardised deployment of Reconyx 2–5 white flash
      camera traps and accompanying bait stations in a fauna plot, either in
      conjunction with a vertebrate fauna survey (recommended) or stand alone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Array protocol – many camera traps (e.g. 20–30) deployed in a systematic
      array (e.g. grid, transect) to monitor fauna occupancy and density in the
      project area (via downstream capture-mark-recapture methods and random
      encounter models).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted protocol – remote cameras deliberately deployed at features of
      interest (e.g. suitable habitat, trail intersections, waterpoints, tree
      hollows, inflorescences) in the project area to maximise fauna detection,
      supplement species inventory, or record behaviour, with the option to
      capture video, orientate camera traps horizontally (i.e. downward-facing
      detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles,
      and use bait stations or lures.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The module covers pre-field survey tasks, including study design
  considerations and remote camera preparation to maximise species detection and
  identification whilst minimising false triggers, as well as post-field survey
  tasks, including data storage, processing, and analysis.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Fauna plot</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
  the standardised deployment and recovery or redeployment of camera traps in a
  fauna plot, including standards for camera make, model and settings, camera
  placement and orientation, site preparation, bait station installation,
  deployment period, and entering the data directly into the App. The protocol
  is based on the standard operating procedure for camera trapping developed by
  the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap guidelines
  (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both standardised methodologies were developed
  from extensive trialing of various camera trap survey designs and consultation
  with a range of expert practitioners, to optimise the effectiveness and
  consistency of camera traps for general vertebrate fauna surveys and
  monitoring. For a standardised protocol that covers the effective and
  consistent use and deployment of remote cameras as part of general vertebrate
  biodiversity surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), the fauna plot protocol
  is the best approach.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Array</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps in an array within the
  project area, including locating camera trap points in an evenly spaced grid
  or at regular intervals along a transect, and then micrositing the exact
  camera trap point locations within the grid or transect to optimise fauna
  detections, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model
  and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target
  species if applicable, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly
  into the App. The protocol has been developed based on the Terrestrial
  Vertebrate (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol (TEAM Network 2011b).
  This protocol was developed from the collective experience of many field
  biologists with experience using camera trap arrays to estimate the abundance
  of a range of terrestrial mammal and bird species. The sampling design was
  carefully specified to maximise the probability of detecting an adequate
  sample of terrestrial mammal and bird species. It was intended to monitor
  changes in the community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates, but not
  to monitor the abundance of individuals species. The sampling design
  compromised between detecting species that range over large areas (&gt;100
  km<sup>2</sup>) and those with smaller home ranges (~1 km<sup>2</sup>). The
  camera trap array protocol outlined here differs in that it allows the
  flexibility to monitor the community or individual species. Surveyors can
  select the density and number of camera traps, and the deployment period based
  on the aims of their project, with this information recorded in a standarised
  manner among projects using the App.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to undertake a general survey of the fauna across a project or
  study area without altering the behaviour of that fauna, the
  <em>Array</em> protocol is the most effective approach. As this protocol can
  be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and uniformly it provides a
  better sample size than the other protocols, thereby enabling a more accurate
  indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this reason,
  an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a camera trap
  array sample is more likely to reflect a true absence (where a species is not
  present) than the other protocols. If resources are limited, establishing a
  transect through the most representative part of the survey area and placing
  camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be the
  best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect samples
  cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is possible to
  combine grid and transect approaches (Molloy 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Targeted</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the
  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps at features of interest
  within the project area, including identifying features of interest, micro
  siting the exact camera trap point locations to optimize fauna detections,
  installing bait stations, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap
  make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point,
  target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a
  standardized manner directly into the App. The targeted protocol may be used
  in combination with the fauna plot protocol to supplement species inventory
  when undertaking fauna monitoring within a project area. The targeted protocol
  has been included in recognition that deliberately biased placement of camera
  traps at features of interest are a commonly used camera trapping sampling
  strategy (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Targeted camera trapping can also be
  undertaken as part of the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/420ce0a7-9364-4bf4-861c-ef5f710e31b9">Targeted surveys<a></em> module and can be used in
  combination with a range of other targeted methods.
</p>
<p>
  If you are monitoring the behaviour of fauna under a certain set of
  conditions, sampling fauna at a specific set of points for experimental
  purposes (e.g., to examine responses of fauna to differing vegetation or
  specific landscape parameters), or monitoring fauna at a place of activity or
  gathering point such as a trail intersection, water point or nest site, the
  <em>Targeted</em> protocol is the most effective approach. This protocol
  allows researchers and practitioners to monitor a large area with minimal
  resources and to answer specific research questions. However, this approach is
  highly susceptible to bias and provides a limited insight into the ecology of
  the greater landscape as a whole (Molloy 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The data standards for all three protocols are based on the
  <em>Camera Trap Metadata Standard</em> developed by Forrester
  <em>et al.</em> (2016), an open data standard for storing and sharing camera
  trap data. The standard captures information necessary to share data between
  projects and offers a foundation for collecting the more detailed data needed
  for downstream analyses. The standard captures information about study design,
  the type of camera trap used, and the location and species names for all
  detections, among others, in a standardized manner. The standard is compatible
  with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Darwin Core, the Ecological
  Metadata Language, and the Audubon Core metadata standards to allow data to be
  easily cross referenced with existing data repositories, such as DataONE
  (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 2016).
</p>
<p>The <em>Camera traps</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  The use of camera traps is popular among scientists and natural resource
  managers to acquire ecological data and evidence of both native and pest
  vertebrate species. Camera traps can be used to assess fauna distribution,
  abundance, behaviour and community structure (Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2013;
  Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014b). Such widespread applications are generating a
  profusion of data, and if methodologies can be standardised, camera trapping
  has the potential to be a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring
  initiatives (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The use of camera traps is becoming more prevalent because they are relatively
  cheap to deploy (after initial purchase costs), reliable, can be left in the
  field for months at a time, do not require expert skills to install, are less
  invasive and potentially more ethical than trapping techniques, are relatively
  safe for both fauna and field personnel (in comparison to trapping and animal
  handing methods), and can be used in situations or terrain which may be
  hazardous for people to work in (Molloy 2018; Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Although camera traps are widely used, the methodological information reported
  in camera trap publications and reports can vary widely, making replication of
  studies and comparison of results difficult (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). For
  this reason, the <em>Camera traps</em> module includes three protocols with
  clear instructions and guidelines for deploying camera traps across Australia.
  Attributes of camera trapping that are covered include: (i) study design; (ii)
  the make and model of the camera trap used; (iii) the camera trap settings
  used; and (iv) the mode of deployment (e.g., camera trap height, angle,
  direction). The metadata associated with these attributes is collected in a
  standardised manner among projects using the App, which ensures the data is
  correct, transparent, complete and suitable for use in ecological or natural
  resource management reports and peer-reviewed papers.
</p>
<p>
  Standardised data collection and reporting of methods and results enables
  greater ease of study replication, more robust comparisons among studies,
  facilitates national and international reviews, and leads to improved fauna
  research and management outcomes (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). A standardised
  approach to camera trap metadata collection is vital given the variability in
  performance among camera trap makes and models, the extensive range of camera
  trap settings now available, and differences in how camera traps are deployed
  in the field. Furthermore, the increasing availability of cyber infrastructure
  for storing and sharing digital data (e.g. from citizen science programs,
  through open access and data sharing frameworks) also requires the key aspects
  of camera trap deployment to be clear and consistent (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2014a).
</p>
<p>
  Camera traps can be more widely used (capture a wider range of fauna species)
  than other survey methods such as pitfall traps or Elliott traps, which are
  tailored to animals of a specific size range (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015).
  In some cases, camera traps may be more effective at detecting small mammals
  than trapping and hair tunnels (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015). Camera traps
  are particularly useful in sampling programs in remote areas, which are
  typically associated with high costs and other logistical constraints of
  operating intensive field sampling programs in these areas (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), including difficulty in accessing broadly spaced
  locations to regularly check live traps (Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Despite high initial costs, camera traps are less costly than labour-intensive
  trapping methods in the long-term. Camera traps can have some major advantages
  over other trapping methods (e.g. pitfall traps) because they can be left in
  the field for extended periods of time (i.e. weeks–months; Dundas
  <em>et al.</em> 2019). Survey periods can be easily extended without having a
  large effect on overall cost, other than increasing image processing time and
  battery use (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although camera trapping shifts
  the labour requirements from field based to office based (Dundas
  <em>et al.</em>
  2019), several computer processes and programs have been developed to manage
  camera trapping datasets and automate image processing (Niedballa
  <em>et al.</em> 2016; Norouzzadeh <em>et al.</em> 2018). Image processing can
  also be undertaken by junior staff and citizen scientists (e.g., DigiVol’s
  Wildlife Spotter program;
  <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/wildlife-spotter"
    >https://volunteer.ala.org.au/wildlife-spotter</a
  >), with expert staff able to focus on confirming identifications rather than
  wading through thousands of images.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the advantages of camera traps, other fauna survey methods still have
  advantages, so using a combination of methods incorporating camera traps may
  be the most appropriate approach to surveying fauna (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Survey effectiveness and cost can be improved by
  surveying taxonomic groups simultaneously with multiple techniques that
  complement one another (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015). The fauna plot
  protocol recognises this and, in most cases, camera trapping within the fauna
  plot is expected to be undertaken in conjunction with the standard vertebrate
  fauna survey. The targeted protocol may also be useful to supplement species
  inventories and gain a more thorough understanding of habitat use, based on
  the ability of camera traps to detect rare and/or elusive species that are
  otherwise difficult to systematically sample by conventional methods
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Technological advances in camera traps are regular and can provide novel
  insights. For this reason, the <em>Camera traps</em> module allows for the
  incorporation of technological advances, with data vocabularies able to update
  to record new camera trap makes, models and specifications as these advances
  occur.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Camera traps</em> module covers the deployment (and recovery or
  redeployment) of camera traps to monitor fauna species across the project
  area. The module includes a standardised protocol for deploying camera traps
  in fauna plots and can be used in conjunction with a vertebrate fauna survey
  or stand-alone, as well as protocols for deploying camera traps in an array
  (e.g., grid, transect) or at features of interest, such as a waterpoint.
  Although the latter two protocols are not standardised in terms of camera trap
  type, layout and setup, the metadata associated with camera trap deployment is
  collected in a standardised manner, which enables minimum data requirements to
  be met, methods to be replicated and more robust comparisons of results among
  studies to be undertaken (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Camera trap study
  design and planning considerations are covered to determine if camera trapping
  is appropriate for your project, and ensure that the appropriate camera trap
  and camera trapping protocols are used based on your research or management
  questions (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The vast majority of camera traps deployed in Australia for vertebrate fauna
  research and management use passive infrared (PIR) sensors (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2012). PIR sensors work by sensing fauna in the camera trap’s
  detection zone that move and are a different temperature relative to the
  ambient temperature and temperature of background surface and objects (i.e.,
  temperature in motion). This automatically triggers the camera trap to capture
  an image, a burst of images, or video depending on the camera trap settings.
  Images or video, which are continually collected over the course of a
  deployment in response to individuals entering the detection zone, are time-
  and date-stamped and stored on an external Secure Digital (SD) memory card.
  Camera traps are often deployed focused on bait stations to attract fauna into
  the detection zone, thereby maximising the likelihood of detection (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Camera traps are an efficient and non-invasive survey tool, which are highly
  accessible to a wide range of practitioners and can be used in a variety of
  research and management applications for native and pest vertebrate fauna.
  They are an efficient way of collecting data over long periods of time with
  minimal time and labour input and minimal stress to the fauna species being
  surveyed. Furthermore, camera traps provide a cost effective means of
  detecting rare and/or elusive species, and capturing and documenting the
  behaviour of animals that are otherwise difficult to observe using
  conventional survey methods (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Camera traps can be used for the following applications (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Simple surveillance – to document a species that may be visiting one or a
      few sites of specific interest (e.g., waterpoint).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      General biodiversity surveys – may be used in conjunction with other
      standardised sampling methods to systematically document spatial patterns
      of vertebrate fauna biodiversity.

        >Targeted fauna surveys</a
      >
      – may be used alone or in combination with other sampling methods to
      determine the spatial distribution of species known to be amenable to
      camera trapping.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Behavioural studies – targeted surveys to assess behaviour, such as
      pollinator visitation (Krauss <em>et al.</em> 2018) and activity patterns
      of micro-endemic species (Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Population density estimates – where an array of cameras is used to
      identify the spatial distribution of uniquely marked individuals of a
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Monitoring – to document changes in occurrence and distribution of
      individual species or a suite of species over time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Management evaluation – to document changes in species occurrence of
      species composition through time and space in response to species
      environmental management interventions, such as vertebrate pest
      management.
