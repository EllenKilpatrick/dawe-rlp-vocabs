    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  Each of the field measures described in this manual, inform on attributes
  which describe biodiversity conditions. The <em>Condition</em> module consists
  of a set of core condition measures, in combination with measures from the
  <em>Recruitment, Coarse woody debris</em> and <em>Fire</em> modules, which in
  combination form the condition set of protocols. The results from other
  modules, including <em>Floristics</em> and <em>Cover</em> also feed into
  condition assessments. This protocol includes step-by-step instructions for
  the core set of condition measures. Refer to the
  <em>Recruitment, Coarse woody debris</em> and <em>Fire</em> modules for survey
  guidelines for these measures (links to the relevant sections are provided
  below).
</p>
<p>There are five main field components to underpin the condition measures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Condition point-intercept: Used to collect the condition point-intercept
      measures using four point-intercept transects (hashtag method), aligned
      with a subset of the existing plot layout described in the
      <em>Cover</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sub-plot assessment: Large tree counts and age class structure assessment
      using a central 40 x 40 m subplot, defined by the boundaries of the
      condition point-intercept transects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plot assessment (visual assessment): Growth-stage and life-stage
      information will be recorded for any perennial species present in the
      plot. Any evidence of vertebrate pests will also be recorded at the plot
      level. A visual assessment of the highest burn point at the site to
      describe fire intensity will be undertaken following the completion of the
      condition point-intercept transect.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Line transect: Line-intercept transects will be used to assess the size
      and quantity of coarse woody debris. The assessment will include 3 x 100 m
      transects running north-south and 3 x 100 m transects running east-west (6
      in total), aligned with the existing plot layout described in the
      <em>Cover</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Belt transect: Belt transects, which align with a subset (5 N/S) of the
      existing transects described in the <em>Cover</em> module are used for
      seedling and sapling counts, and the small tree survey.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Condition module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821"
          >Plot selection and layout</a
        ></em
      >
      – The plot selection module needs to be undertaken before any condition
      surveys can take place. Plot selection should consider control and impact
      sites, and where necessary the inclusion of benchmark plots.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em

          >Plot description</a
        ></em
      >
      – Disturbance information collected as part of the plot description module
      can be used to supplement condition data and help provide a more complete
      description of condition.
    </p>
  </li>

          >Cover</a
        ></em
      >
      – The <em>Condition</em> module uses a subset of the point-intercept
      transects established during the cover module. Condition assessments
      should be completed after cover to make use of the tapes that have already
      been set up. The results of the cover module feed into the overall
      condition assessments and analysis, and provide information about native
      and weed cover.
    </p>

          >Floristics</a
        ></em
      >
      – The <em>Floristics</em> module needs to be completed before the
      condition point-intercept, recruitment belt-transects and growth and
      life-stage assessments are undertaken. Information can only be entered
      against species (or field names) recorded during the floristics module.
      The results from the floristics module provide information on the
      diversity of native and weed plant species, which are important condition
      measures.

          >Fire</a
        ></em
      >
      – Sections of the <em>Fire</em> module need to be completed as part of the
      condition assessment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Interventions</em> – Condition assessments should be undertaken before
      and after any interventions occur. The condition protocol is focused
      predominantly in assessing changes in condition following on-ground
      interventions. It is recommended that condition assessments are undertaken
      in impact (intervention) and control sites.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="general-overview">Field collection - General overview</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Assessment should be undertaken at suitable time(s) of year to ensure
      species are detectable (e.g. annual herbs) and identifiable (e.g.
      grasses). Repeat visits should be undertaken at the same time(s) as the
      baseline assessments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plot boundaries will be marked out according to the existing method
      described in the <em>Plot Selection and Layout</em> module. For the
      purposes of the condition point-intercept, four 100 m transects are then
      marked on the 30 m and 70 m transect lines, both in the north-south and
      east-west orientation as shown below (Figure 2).
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Figure 2. Condition point-intercept transect design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The 40 x 40 m subplot is defined by the central area (30-70 m) within the
      four condition point-intercept transects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assessment across the plot is used to document signs of pest animals,
      record fire scar height, and document growth and life-stages of the
      perennial species present.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      CWD assessments occur across 6 transects (although survey design
      variations exist), with 3 transects running N/S and 3 E/W.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Recruitment is measured using narrow belt transects (2 m wide), that align
      with the transects established in the <em>Cover</em> module. The belt
      transect boundary is defined using the point-intercept staff and does not
      require any further tapes to be laid out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assessment of fire extent and severity is undertaken as part of the
      <em>Cover</em> module. If a condition survey is to be undertaken, ensure
      that the fire option has been activated in the <em>Cover</em> module.

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>
  Adequate monitoring of condition remains a prerequisite for environmental
  decision-making and for tracking progress towards management goals (Lawley
  <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, condition data is patchy and despite a number
  of approaches being developed there is still no consistent way to assess
  condition across the country (NERP National Condition Working Group 2015). As
  a result, there is a need for cost-effective condition assessments that
  provide robust and rigorous data (Cook <em>et al.</em> 2010). An understanding
  of condition is needed to inform regional priorities, establish policies,
  design and evaluate natural resource management (NRM) programs and measure
  change (Thackway <em>et al.</em> 2015). At the project scale, monitoring
  condition allows the response of ecological attributes such as ground cover
  and native plant diversity to be determined in relation to management
  interventions or developments. At a broader scale, data from a range of
  projects can provide information on the overall performance of RLP programs,
  across interventions, vegetation types and regions (Commonwealth of Australia
  2013; Eco Logical Australia 2013), and for development projects can help
  determine if environmental impacts on matters of national environmental
  significance are being managed appropriately (Commonwealth of Australia 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Condition tends to be measured by visual and/or systematic assessments (Casson
  <em>et al.</em> 2009; Cook <em>et al.</em> 2010; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015;
  Neldner 2006), but visual estimates can be highly variable compared to
  systematic assessments, especially at small scales. Observers often simplify
  their assessments by responding to only some of the condition parameters, and
  as a result, more systematic assessments are needed when management decisions
  require an understanding of changes in individual condition attributes (Cook
  <em>et al.</em> 2010). In addition, a greater range of analysis options are
  available when the data is collected as raw (continuous) rather than
  categorical data. This information allows changes in individual attributes to
  be monitored, aggregated and analysed to explore a range of issues related to
  condition and allows each attribute to be analysed individually (ESCAVI 2007;
  Williams 2010).
</p>
<p>
  Determining what attributes should be monitored for condition assessments can
  be difficult and often results in a long list of indicators being measured
  (Bleby <em>et al.</em> 2008), which can waste time and resources. The approach
  outlined in this module has been developed to align with existing condition
  assessment methods where possible but improves the way condition is measured
  across the country by focusing on the collection of quantitative data. A
  summary of each attribute, reason for collection and survey methods are
  detailed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Growth stage (plot and point-intercept; recruitment and condition
        modules):</strong
      >
      Growth stage (recruiting, resprouting, mature, senescent, dead) is
      recorded across the 1 ha plot for every perennial species present as part
      of the recruitment module. Multiple growth stages can be recorded for each
      species. Growth stage is also recorded using the condition
      point-intercept, with the growth-stage recorded for each perennial
      individual intercepted. Recording growth stage as a measure of condition
      is recommended by a number of sources (Bleby <em>et al.</em> 2008; Gibbons
      and Freudenberger 2006a; b; Parkes and Lyon 2006), as it helps to
      characterise the structural diversity of the system (Milne
      <em>et al.</em> 2008). Recording growth stage using two methods allows
      growth stage to be recorded for every perennial species present and also
      provides an estimate for the abundance of each stage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Life-stage (plot; recruitment module):</strong> Life-stage is
      recorded across the plot to provide an overview of the potential for
      recruitment of all perennial species present as part of the recruitment
      module. Eight life-stage classes have been defined (seedling, sapling,
      vegetative, budding, flowering, immature fruit, mature fruit, recently
      shed) based on the work by Heard and Channon (1997).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Age class structure (sub-plot, condition module):</strong> Age
      class structure is recorded using two methods in the central 40 x 40 m
      sub-plot. The first measure is a count of trees and shrubs that fall into
      seven DBH size classes (&lt;5, 5-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-49, 50-79 and 80+ cm)
      and aligns with the NSW Biodiversity Assessment Method (Department of
      Planning Industry and Environment 2020). The second measure is a count of
      all large trees present, recorded on a per species (or per genus) basis,
      with the DBH thresholds for large trees varying by major vegetation groups
      (Eco Logical Australia 2013). A mix of stem sizes indicates multiple
      successful recruitment events have occurred and the presence of very large
      individuals indicates that the system retains old-growth characteristics
      such as tree-hollows and roosting sites which can be important for a range
      of fauna species (Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2007).

      Seedling and sapling counts are undertaken along 5 belt transects, that
      are 2 m wide as part of the recruitment module. Seedling and sapling
      counts are undertaken to get an estimate of the number of recruits for the
      tree and shrub species present in the system, with counts undertaken on a
      per species or per genus basis (Department of Conservation 2019), where
      possible. Recruitment is an important condition measure because it
      provides insights into how the system is functioning, and for species to
      persist in the long-term, they need to be able to successfully produce new
      generations of plants (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012).
      In degraded systems, the presence of seedlings and saplings helps to
      determine whether the land has a capacity to regenerate (DENR 2011).

      <strong>Small tree survey (belt-transects; recruitment module):</strong>
      Small tree surveys are undertaken in the same belt transects as the
      seedling and sapling counts. The location, size and life-stage are
      recorded for all small trees present, to help document age class
      structure, assist with the interpretation of changes that occur over time
      and to estimate the number of new individuals established in the
      population (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012).

      <strong>Vegetation health (point-intercept; condition module):</strong>
      Vegetation health is recorded during the point-intercept, with health
      recorded for every perennial species intercepted. Health measures include
      canopy health (percent healthy canopy), dieback from disease, epicormic
      growth, number of mistletoes, galls and lerps, insect damage and grazing
      damage. Vegetation health is an important measure of condition, and
      several factors can contribute to a decline in health, including diseases,
      pathogens and plant parasites (Department of the Environment 2014). In
      disturbed or fragmented landscapes, changes in environmental conditions
      such as nutrient accumulations, loss of birds and water stress can make
      plants more susceptible to insect damage, including galls and lerps, and
      an increase in mistletoes can also be an indicator of plant stress in
      fragmented systems (Casson
      <em>et al.</em> 2009). Grazing can reduce plant productivity, habitat
      value and biodiversity, hydrological function and carbon sequestration
      (Eldridge and Delgado‐Baquerizo 2017), so high levels of grazing can
      result in a loss of condition.

      <strong>Litter depth (point-intercept; condition module):</strong>
      Litter depth (mm) is recorded during the point-intercept, with depth
      recorded whenever litter is intercepted. The litter depth is the distance
      between the mineral soil surface and the top of the litter surface (Hines
      <em>et al.</em> 2010). Litter can provide a habitat for some
      ground-dwelling fauna and predator invertebrates (McElhinny
      <em>et al.</em> 2006), a substrate for the regeneration of plant species
      (Oliver and Parkes 2003), shelter and food for detritus-feeding
      invertebrates (Majer <em>et al.</em> 1997; Oliver and Parkes 2003), and
      also plays a role in soil surface stability and can reduce erosion (Casson
      <em>et al.</em> 2009).

        >Coarse woody debris (transects; coarse woody debris module):</strong
      >
      Coarse woody debris (CWD) is recorded using 6 transects, with the length
      and diameters (widest and narrowest) recorded for any pieces that
      intercept the transects. CWD contributes to a range of ecosystem
      processes, including nutrient cycling and storage, soil formation,
      stability, and retention, retaining moisture and enhancing water
      infiltration, improving thermal conditions, and providing sites for litter
      accumulation (Goldin 2020; Grove and Meggs 2003; Manning et al. 2013;
      Woldendorp et al. 2004). CWD can also influence fuel loads and fire
      dynamics (Miehs et al. 2010), and is a preferred habitat feature for a
      range of fauna, including shelter, nesting and denning sites for a variety
      of mammals, reptiles and some birds (Mac Nally et al. 2001; Threlfall et
      al. 2021).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Fire (point-intercept; fire module):</strong> Fire extent and
      severity are determined using the point-intercept, with burn distribution,
      vegetation char, scorch height and soil char depth recorded. Fire severity
      is defined as the degree of consumption and scorching of live vegetation
      and dead fuel, and the degree to which soil properties and processes are
      altered, as a result of the combustion process (Hammill and Bradstock
      2006; Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). The cover measurements are indicative
      of fire extent and patchiness (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013), while the
      height measurements provide insight into the degree of scorching and
      charring of the living and dead vegetation in each strata, which are key
      indicators of fire severity (Chafer 2008; Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013;
      Hammill and Bradstock 2006; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015; Russell-Smith
      and Edwards 2006; Whight and Bradstock 1999). Fire has a major effect on
      terrestrial ecosystems and can influence plant diversity, composition and
      regeneration, and high frequency burning can result in the loss of fire
      sensitive vegetation (Etchells <em>et al.</em> 2020; Fisher
      <em>et al.</em> 2009; Yibarbuk <em>et al.</em> 2001).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Vertebrate pest fauna (plot; condition module):</strong> Pest
      animal presence will be recorded at the plot level, with evidence of
      tracks, scats, warrens, diggings or other signs/traces recorded
      (Commonwealth of Australia 2013). There will be a focus on recording
      evidence of feral cats, foxes, wild dogs, rabbits, pigs, goats, deer,
      horses and camels, but other invasive species can also be included. Pest
      animals can cause land degradation by promoting soil erosion and
      compaction, stream turbidity, the spread of weeds, and can threaten native
      plant species and animals through competition, habitat destruction,
      over-grazing and predation (Invasive Plants and Animals Committee 2016).
      Consequently, the presence of vertebrate pest fauna can be an indicator of
      reductions in condition (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009; Krull
      <em>et al.</em> 2015; Pert <em>et al.</em> 2012).

<h3 id="analysing-condition-data">Analysing condition data</h3>
<p>
  Condition is generally assessed by measuring a range of features and then
  combining these into an index of condition, which is then compared against a
  benchmark to generate a condition score (Cook et al. 2010). Benchmarks are
  generally based on a pre-European (1750) state, prior to significant
  development and disturbance (Thackway et al. 2015), or a Best on Offer site
  (Eyre et al. 2017). Once a set of benchmarks have been established for a
  vegetation type, the condition of any example of that type can be quantified
  by comparing the site values with the benchmark values (Eyre et al. 2015;
  Parkes et al. 2003). Condition scores can be generated from a mix of field and
  remote measures (Eyre et al. 2015; Harwood et al. 2016; Lawley et al. 2016;
  McFarlane and Wallace 2019), and to generate condition scores, primary data is
  usually converted into an attribute condition score, and then weighted and
  aggregated into a single site multi-metric score (Eyre et al. 2015; Oliver et
  al. 2014). This approach can be straightforward and easy to understand, and
  allows a range of information to be presented as a simple numeric or visual
  summary (Pert et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>
  However, multi-metric condition scores have two main shortcomings including:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><p>Loss of useful information at the attribute level, and</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Generation of similar condition scores for very different sites through
      attribute eclipsing - the absence of one attribute being compensated for
      by the presence of another (Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative approach is to assess each condition attribute individually
      against a baseline or reference measure. This approach avoids masking
      individual attribute scores, which allows a more thorough understanding of
      the outcomes of management actions (ESCAVI 2007; Milne et al. 2008), and
      as such is the approach recommended here. In addition, benchmarks are
      incomplete and lack consistency across Australia and given these
      limitations, a range of analysis methods are required (Eco Logical
      Australia 2013).
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection of condition data using this protocol is focused on
      recording continuous rather than categorical data, as this allows
      flexibility when analysing and interpreting data. Collecting data in this
      way allows changes in individual attributes to be monitored, aggregated
      and analysed to explore a range of issues related to vegetation condition
      (Williams 2010). Analysis can be undertaken in a range or ways or a
      combination of ways, using the data collected, including:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Comparison of intervention (treatment) and control plots over time,

      <li>
        <p>
          Generation of benchmarks from suitable nearby reference areas using
          the same plot methods, to allow comparison of condition attributes
          from intervention or development areas, against relatively unmodified
          or best on offer reference areas.

<p>
  The <em>Condition</em> module involves the collection of quantitative,
  accurate and repeatable measures of condition attributes within the plot,
  using a combination of point-intercept, transect, belt-transect and plot-based
  methods (Figure 1). The <em>Condition</em> module includes methods for
  collecting data on plant age class structure, plant health, litter depth, pest
  vertebrate fauna presence, coarse woody debris, recruitment and fire. The
  <em>Coarse woody debris, Recruitment</em> and <em>Fire</em> modules form part
  of the <em>Condition</em> module and data from other modules such as
  <em>Floristics</em> and <em>Cover</em> are also important measures for the
  overall assessment of condition. The definition of condition adopted here is
  revised from the AusPlots Draft Condition Protocol (Wundke
  <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >Biodiversity condition is a measure of the status of the biota at an
      assessment site described by key attributes that reflect structure,
      function and composition.</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The Condition protocol has been designed to take existing condition monitoring
  methods into consideration, but to also improve consistency and repeatability
  in the way condition is measured across the country and provide increased
  opportunities for analysis. The primary aim of the Condition module is to
  collect baseline and revisit data for Regional Land Partnerships (RLP)
  projects, so any changes in condition following interventions can be
  evaluated. The condition module can also contribute to environmental impact
  assessments (EIAs) and to assist with monitoring change in condition following
  development activities. The recommended approach for analysis is to focus on
  assessing change in the individual attributes that contribute to condition,
  rather than generating overall condition scores. However, the calculation of
  multi-metric condition scores, assessment against benchmarks and broader scale
  condition assessments are possible.
</p>
<p>
  There is a growing demand for consistent, good quality condition data across
  Australia (Brocklehurst and Price 2008), as almost all environments have been
  affected by changes in land use and land management practices (Thackway 2014).
  Condition tends to be measured by visual and/or systematic assessments, and
  key measures include the composition, structure, and function of the
  vegetation. Vegetation condition is often used as a surrogate for the overall
  biodiversity condition (Neldner 2006), but a range of other factors can also
  be included (Eco Logical Australia 2013; NERP National Condition Working Group
  2015; Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015). Measures such as native species cover and
  diversity, soil surface cover, plant age class structure, litter depth, weed
  cover, coarse woody debris, recruitment and fire are regularly included in
  condition assessments (Bleby <em>et al.</em> 2008; Capon <em>et al.</em> 2020;
  Williams 2010). As more attributes are assessed, the overall picture of
  biodiversity condition becomes more comprehensive (Casson
  <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, one of the main challenges for developing
  condition protocols, is deciding on a set of attributes that are flexible
  enough to be applied across Australia, but are also robust, repeatable and
  cost effective (NERP National Condition Working Group 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Existing frameworks and procedures to assess condition differ in approach, and
  this is reflective of the range of legislative, management and policy
  objectives in place, as well as available resources (Eyre
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Methods and protocols for assessing and monitoring
  condition have been developed in all states and territories (Williams 2010),
  and include BioCondition in Queensland (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015),
  Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM) in New South Wales (Department of
  Planning Industry and Environment 2020), Habitat Hectare Assessment in
  Victoria (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2004), TasVeg in
  Tasmania (Michaels 2006), Bushland Condition Monitoring (BCM) in South
  Australia (Milne et al. 2008), Vegetation Condition Assessment in the Northern
  Territory (Brocklehurst and Price 2008) and Native Vegetation Condition
  Assessment in Western Australia (Casson et al. 2009). However, the degree
  these methods have been adopted and utilised varies between states and
  territories. A number of other protocols have also been developed, which
  include those suitable at regional levels, through to the national scale (e.g.
  (Commonwealth of Australia 2013; Craig et al. 2008; Eco Logical Australia
  2013; Eyre et al. 2011; Williams 2010; Wundke et al. 2015)).
</p>
<p>
  The methods developed by the states and territories have generally been
  designed as practical, rapid assessments, appropriate for use by
  non-specialists. All have a measure of species composition, plant cover, life
  history, weeds and logs, and all assess regeneration or recruitment of canopy
  or woody species as a measure of ecosystem function. To measure condition,
  these methods generally involve comparison against a reference or benchmark
  state (Williams 2010). The methods developed here align with existing state
  and territory methods, where possible, and builds from the methods developed
  for the AusPlots Draft Condition Protocols Manual (Wundke
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The condition assessment framework presented here, draws on data from a range
  of attributes, sourced from a number of the modules, including a core set from
  the <em>Condition</em> module, as well as data from the <em>Recruitment</em>,
  <em>Coarse woody debris</em>, <em>Fire</em>, <em>Floristics</em> and
  <em>Cover</em> modules<em>.</em> Where required, condition assessments can
  also include data from other modules, including
  <em>Vertebrate fauna, Invertebrate fauna</em> and <em>Soils.</em>
