<ul>
<li><p>Partitioning the sub-plot into more manageable units using
existing Cover point-intercept transect tapes, additional tapes and/or
coloured survey pins is highly recommended, particularly in dense
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot boundaries should be marked out according to the existing
method described in the Plot Selection and Layout Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment across the plot is used to document signs of pest
fauna, record fire scar height, and document age class structure, growth
and life-stages, and health of the perennial species present.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of fire extent and severity is undertaken in the Fire
Module (which is carried out within the Cover Module). If a condition
survey is to be undertaken, ensure that the fire option has been
activated in the Cover Module.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tree-survey-1">Tree survey </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A tree is considered in the plot if than 50% of the base of the
trunk is within the plot (Figure 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Tree height can be estimated using a forestry rangefinder for
rapid and accurate height measurements. The person entering the data
into the Monitor app can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over their
shoulder and record tree height when required.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be
estimated using the following methods:</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tree-health">Tree health</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="canopy-cover">Canopy cover</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Canopy cover is assessed as the percentage of foliage missing
from the canopy relative to a reference tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference trees can be an archetype of a species with optimal
foliage (absolute reference tree), or a nearby tree with maximum foliage
considering site conditions, altitude, latitude, etc., (local reference)
(Dobbertin 2005; Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>Local reference trees are generally best, and a suitable tree is
one that is presumed to be completely healthy (i.e. stress-free), of the
same species, similar age and with maximum foliage (Dobbertin 2005;
Thimonier <em>et al.</em> 2010; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Canopy cover is scored in 5% increments, and a healthy tree would
have a canopy cover score of 100% (i.e. 0% defoliation or dieback),
whereas a tree with 25% dieback would have a canopy score of
75%.</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate percentage canopy, visualise a circle around the
outer boundary of the crown. Estimate the proportion of dead crown and
the remainder is the proportion of healthy crown cover (Michaels
2006).</p></li>
<li><p>Epicormic shoots below the crown, absent or fallen branches, and
lower limbs that do not form part of the canopy are not included in
assessable canopy (Michaels 2006; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em>
2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="crown-damage-index">Crown Damage Index</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The incidence and severity of each type of foliage damage
(necrosis, discolouration and defoliation) is also assessed for each
tree (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003). Incidence (<em>I</em>) is the
percentage of leaves in the canopy affected, and severity (<em>S</em>)
is the percentage of each individual leaf affected. Info buttons will be
provided in the app for easy reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Incidence and severity scores for each type of damage are then
multiplied together and divided by 100 i.e., (<em>I</em> x
<em>S)</em>/100.</p></li>
<li><p>The results for each are then added to produce an overall Crown
Damage Index (CDI).</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, the crown can be divided and the incidence and
severity across all types of damage can be estimated for each portion
and then summed to produce an overall CDI.</p></li>
<li><p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p></li>
<li><p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(Figure A5.1)</p></li>
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (Figure A5.2)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (Figure A5.2).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example <em>Eucalyptus</em> leaves can change colour
as they develop.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="general-guidelines-for-canopy-health">General
guidelines for canopy health</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Although assessments of canopy cover and foliage damage are
subjective, observer bias can be reduced by having the same observer
team for each survey, creating a photo library of local reference trees
with typical canopy morphology, and intercalibrating between observers
and across surveys (Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to observe each tree from several positions,
ideally standing at a distance equal to the height of the tree. An
elevated position ensures a better view.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible take a closer look at branches, leaves and stems
for signs as to what may be causing the stress symptoms (e.g. galls and
lerps, boreholes etc., are indicative of insect infestation. Appendix 6
provides examples of the types of damage produced by insect and
disease). Binoculars are helpful for looking higher into the canopy. Use
the comments field to add notes regarding potential causes of
damage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="mistletoe">Mistletoe </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all mistletoes are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Only record living mistletoe.</p></li>
<li><p>Mistletoe abundance generally increases with tree height,
diameter and basal area.</p></li>
<li><p>Trees close to a patch edge or another infested individual are
more likely to host mistletoe (Ward 2005).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="hollows">Hollows</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all hollows are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="leaf-litter">Leaf litter </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Leaf litter is all the plant organic matter above the top layer
of the compacted soil, mostly consisting of decaying and dry leaves
(Moses <em>et al.</em> 2021), but can also include needles, grass, twigs
and bark (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p></li>
<li><p>Leaf litter does not include coarse woody debris or woody
debris.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the ruler through the litter until it reaches the soil
surface. The soil surface should be firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Measures of litter depth can have low accuracy (Marimon-Junior
and Hay 2008), so ensure that the light pressure applied until there is
even contact with the litter surface is consistent across sampling
locations.</p></li>
<li><p>If leaf litter measurement device is not available, an equivalent
can be created with a standard 30 cm ruler and a piece of cardboard.
Ensure that the tool used is consistent throughout the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>The same individual should conduct all leaf litter measurements
to reduce error.</p></li>

<p><span class="anchor" id="_Toc140825975"></span><h4>Appendix 1. Assessing
crown damage and calculating the Crown Damage Index (CDI).</h4></p>
<p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>
<p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(Figure A5.1)</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (<a href="#figure-A2">Figure A2</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (<a href="#figure-A2">Figure A2</a>).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example eucalyptus leaves can change colour as they
develop.</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="calculating-cdi">Calculating CDI</h5>
<p>CDI is calculated by multiplying, for each type of damage or each
portion of the crown, the incidence (<em>I</em>) by the severity
(<em>S</em>), and then dividing the product by 100. If there are several
types of damage present, or sections of crown affected, these values are
then summed to produce and overall value.</p>
<p>For example, if calculating CDI based on each type of damage present,
imagine a tree where:</p>
<p>50% of leaves are affected by defoliation (<em>S</em> = 50%) with on
average about 30% of individual leaves missing (<em>I</em> = 30%)</p>
<p>+ 20% necrotic damage per leaf (<em>S</em> = 20%) to the lower 15% of
the canopy (<em>I</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>+ 10% of leaves (<em>I</em> = 10%) are discoloured with around 15% of
each leaf affected (<em>S</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>= (50 x 30)/100 + (20 x 15)/100 + (15 x 10)/100 = 15 + 3 + 1.5</p>
<p>CDI = 19.5</p>

<p>Alternatively, if estimating CDI by dividing the canopy into smaller
sections and looking at total damage in each portion, the calculations
might look like this:</p>

<p>Either approach can be used, or a combination of the two approaches
(i.e. each type of damage for sections of the crown). The default in the
App is a single row for an overall assessment of damage across the
crown.</p>
