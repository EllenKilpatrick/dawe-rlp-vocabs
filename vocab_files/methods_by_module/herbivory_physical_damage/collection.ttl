<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols </h2>
<p>The Herbivory and Physical Damage Module outlines the procedures and
guidelines of three protocols for recording herbivory and physical
damage present in a project area:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Within-plot belt transect protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Off-plot belt transect protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Active plot search protocol.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The module is appropriate for monitoring all fauna species, including
pest species. Depending on the project aims and location, herbivory and
physical damage surveys can consist of a single protocol or a
combination of a belt transect protocol and the Active plot search
protocol. Where possible, protocols of the Herbivory and Physical Damage
module should be undertaken within or near an established 1 ha Core
Monitoring Plot or Fauna Plot so that the data can be analysed in
combination with vegetation and landform data collected.</p>
<p>The Within-plot belt transect protocol involves a 100 m belt
transect, divided into 100 consecutive 1 m x 1 m quadrats. An estimate
of damage (percent of quadrat with physical damage, such as wallowing or
digging), percent cover (vegetation, substrate) and a herbivory score is
given to each quadrat.</p>
<p>The Off-plot belt transect protocol is a variation to the Within-plot
belt transect protocol, allowing a more flexible approach over larger
areas, where the user specifies the length and width of the belt
transect (e.g. 50 x 4 m, 100 x 2 m), as well as the number of quadrats
(minimum of 10) and their length and width. These transects can be used
to record the signs present within each quadrat, and to undertake warren
or den counts. This approach can utilise straight-line transects or can
occur along tracks, alongside watercourses or other features. Longer
transects are useful to understand broader scale trends across the
project area.</p>
<p>The active plot search protocol involves either traversing a 100 x
100 m Core Monitoring Plot or Fauna Plot, or a 40 x 40 m subset area and
recording the presence or absence of herbivory and physical damage, and
completing a count of all herbivory and physical damage present. The
active plot search protocol is best used where herbivory and physical
damage is isolated and not homogenous across the project area. The
active plot search protocol may be undertaken in unison with the
Condition Module.</p>
<h2 id="relationships-to-other-modules">Relationships to other
modules</h2>
<h3 id="mandatory-related-modules">Mandatory related modules</h3>
<p>Mandatory if the Within-plot belt transect or Active plot search
protocols are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plot Selection and Layout Module – within-plot 100 m belt
transects and active plot searches are undertaken within Core Monitoring
Plots or Fauna Plots. Therefore, ensure that the Plot Selection and
Layout Module has been completed before commencing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-complementary-related-modules">Optional complementary
related modules</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sign-based Fauna Survey Module – both modules can be implemented
in unison, whereby signs of fauna and the extent of physical damage or
herbivory is recorded within plots (belt transects, entire plot or
subset area) or off-plot belt transects. Signs of fauna species may
provide an indication of the presence and abundance of species
responsible for herbivory or physical damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertebrate Fauna Module –monitoring data may provide an
indication of the presence and abundance of fauna species responsible
for herbivory or physical damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Camera Trapping Module – camera traps may be used to identify
fauna species responsible for herbivory or physical damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Interventions Module and Pest Fauna Control Activities Module –
the presence of herbivory and physical damage can inform the localities
and details of management activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Targeted Surveys Module – herbivory and physical damage can also
be recorded during a targeted survey. Targeted surveys should only be
used when no other EMSA module can be applied to the project's specific
needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Floristics Module and Cover Module –information on the
composition and cover of palatable species can help determine the number
of within-plot belt transects that will be surveyed, or the suitable
active plot search area.</p></li>
<li><p>Photopoints Module – the panoramic photos taken from the centre
of the plot provide a visual representation of the plot, including any
herbivory and physical damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Condition Module – measures of herbivory and physical damage can
be incorporated into assessments and monitoring of biodiversity
condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportune Module – opportune observations of herbivory and
physical damage may identify the need to implement the Herbivory and
Physical Damage Module protocols.</p></li>

    tern:purpose """<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Herbivory and physical damage surveys offer an indirect, non-invasive
measure of presence and impact. These surveys are generally easy to
undertake and require little specialised equipment or training. They are
particularly useful for cryptic, nocturnal, elusive species or species
that occur in low abundance. In some instances, the herbivory and
physical damage caused by some species, are more conspicuous than the
animals themselves (Mitchell and Balogh 2007b; Claridge 2016; Indigo
<em>et al.</em> 2021; Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2022). Palatable plants
are consumed by pest fauna, including rabbits, feral deer, goats and
pigs (Davis and Coulson 2016; Burrows 2018; Finlayson et al. 2021). The
nature of the damage to vegetation can help to reveal the species
responsible. For example, up to 60 cm high grazing lines and chisel-like
cuts on shrubs is indicative of rabbit (or rarely hare) damage (Williams
et al. 1995; Bird et al. 2012; ACT Government 2015). Herbivory and
physical damage surveys can be useful when direct observations of fauna
are not required or are difficult to obtain and to supplement direct
survey methods to get a more comprehensive understanding of distribution
and impacts (Hone 1988; Mitchell and Balogh 2007b; Moriarty and Brown
2012; NPCA 2020).</p>
<p>The Herbivory and Physical Damage Module consists of two protocols
that can be used alone or in combination, depending on the aims and
requirements of the project, target fauna and the environment type. The
Belt transect protocol is the most comprehensive method. It has been
designed to align with the vegetation or fauna plot so that fauna data
can be analysed with other ecological information, such as floristics,
vegetation cover and fauna diversity. The module has a tiered approach,
allowing the information collected to be tailored to the project's
needs. The number of quadrats with herbivory and physical damage can be
monitored over time to understand fauna activity and impacts. The Belt
transect protocol is based on established methods and has been adapted
to align with the 1 ha plot, to facilitate more in-depth data analysis.
A variation to the method is also available and allows a more flexible
approach over larger areas, where the user specifies quadrat width,
length, and number (minimum of 10 quadrats). Longer transects are useful
to understand broader scale trends across the project area (based on the
presence of herbivory and physical damage).</p>
<p>The 2 ha Arid Zone Monitoring (AZM) (Indigo <em>et al.</em> 2021)
approach, which forms the basis of the active plot search method, is
well established and regularly used to monitor the presence of arid zone
fauna. The data are statistically robust and relatively inexpensive to
measure but are only applicable to monitoring the presence and
distribution of fauna rather than abundance (Southgate and Moseby 2008;
Indigo et al. 2021). The tools and resources developed for the AZM,
including a standard data collection template, workflow and metadata,
have been integrated into this module. The module offers a rapid
approach (approximately 30 minutes per 2 ha area), suitable for use in
the arid zone and can document a range of fauna species. The method
requires minimal training and no specialised equipment (Southgate and
Moseby 2008; Indigo et al. 2021). A variation to this approach is also
available for use in non-arid systems. It aligns to the 1 ha fauna plot
or the vegetation plot, streamlining data collection where other modules
are implemented simultaneously.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

<p>Fauna can cause visible impacts to the soil and vegetation in the
landscape, impacts which can be used to identify their presence and
quantify their relative abundance (Cowled and Lapidge 2004; Mitchell and
Balogh 2007b; Engeman <em>et al.</em> 2013). Disturbance can consist of
physical damage to soil, vegetation or water bodies. Physical damage is
usually a consequence of digging, creation of trail pathways, rooting,
pugging, wallowing, rubbing, trampling and browsing (Mitchell and Balogh
2007b, 2007a, 2007c; Engeman <em>et al.</em> 2013; Bradford and Westcott
2015; Higashide <em>et al.</em> 2021; Hradsky <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>The most appropriate protocol, or combination of protocols, within
the Herbivory and Physical Damage Module can be selected on a
project-by-project basis, depending on the target species. Surveying for
herbivory and physical damage can be undertaken within core monitoring
and fauna plots, to provide a more comprehensive picture of ecological
impacts and intervention outcomes.</p>
<p>The Herbivory and Physical Damage Module includes three
protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transect</p></li>
<li><p>Off-plot belt transect</p></li>
<li><p>Active plot search.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each protocol, the following data is recorded:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Presence/absence of each damage type, and attributable
species</p></li>
<li><p>Count of each instance of damage, and attributable species
(optional)</p></li>
<li><p>Age of the damage (optional).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Physical damage recorded can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Burrow, warren and den</p></li>
<li><p>Pad</p></li>
<li><p>Trail and pathway through vegetation</p></li>
<li><p>Rooting and pugging</p></li>
<li><p>Digging</p></li>
<li><p>Rub or rutting on tree</p></li>
<li><p>Roll pit and wallow</p></li>
