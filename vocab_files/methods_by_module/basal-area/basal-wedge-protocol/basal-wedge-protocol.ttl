  <li>
    Ensure the Plot selection and layout module has been completed to mark out
    the plot grid (including the Centrepoint and north, south, east and west
    point sampling locations) with very high accuracy using the Trimble&reg; R1.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the App and navigate to the &lsquo;Basal Area&rsquo; module and then
    the &lsquo;Basal Wedge Protocol&rsquo;.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stand at one of the 9 basal wedge sampling locations and
    select the location from the drop-down list (Appendix A). It does not matter
    which order the sampling locations are surveyed in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the &lsquo;Record basal wedge sampling location&rsquo; button to
    record the location with very high accuracy using the Trimble&reg; R1.
    Because the method involves a plotless sweep, location accuracy at the NW,
    N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W points around the perimeter of the plot, as well
    as the center of the plot is not critical.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hold the end knot of the 50 cm length of string attached to the wedge on
    your cheek below one eye &ndash; close the other eye. Hold the wedge so that
    the string is taught.

  <li>
    Determine if the use of the basal wedge is warranted at the plot (i.e., are
    there sufficient trunks or stems of trees, tall shrubs or mallee that are
    large enough to count seven or more &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for any species).
  </li>
  <li>
    For each species, establish which BAF (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2) to
    use. This is determined by selecting a BAF and undertaking a brief sweep
    around the point sampling location to determine if the selected BAF will
    sample seven or more &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees (see Additional guidelinesbelow
    for rules on counting &lsquo;in&rsquo; and &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; trees)
    for the sampling location. Ideally aim to the achieve the minimum seven
    &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees with the largest aperture width.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you have selected the appropriate BAF for a species, rotate through a
    complete 360&deg; sweep and, looking through the eye above the string, count
    the number of stems or trunks of each species, at breast height, that are
    wider than the aperture of the chosen BAF as &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and the exact
    width of the aperture as &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; (i.e., half count).
  </li>
  <li>
    Record the species, the tally of &lsquo;in&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; trees and the BAF used (from drop-down list;
    Appendix A) for the sampling location and select the &lsquo;Save
    species&rsquo; button.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 7&ndash;9 for the remaining species at the sampling location.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the &lsquo;Finish sampling location&rsquo; button to return to the
    sampling location selection screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 3&ndash;11 at each remaining sampling location. When all the
    sampling locations have been assessed, the App will display a data summary
    (e.g., mean basal area, total stem counts) on the sampling location
    selection screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    When basal area has been recorded for each species at each sampling
    location, select the &lsquo;Finish module&rsquo; button to return to the
    module selection screen.

<p>Rules to determine ‘in’ trees</p>
<ul>
    <li>
      Examples of how to score trees using the TERN Basal Wedge are illustrated.
    </li>
    <li>
      A tree is &lsquo;in&rsquo; when its trunk or stem, at breast height (1.3 m,
      or the nearest point above if there is a deformity at 1.3 m), is wider than
      the chosen BAF.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not record the data if less than seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for a given
      BAF are achieved for each species. Data become meaningless with less than
      seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees. Repeat the sweep using a smaller BAF, or if
      there are less than seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees with the smallest BAF
      (0.1), no data is recorded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Where the trunk or stem is exactly the same width as the BAF (i.e.
      &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; tree), add a half count to your tally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Select the widest suitable BAF to sample seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for
      the species. This increases efficiency as it reduces the numbers of
      &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees likely. For example, use the &lsquo;1&rsquo; BAF to
      record eight &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees rather than the &lsquo;0.5&rsquo; BAF to
      record 15 &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is more efficient to use the same BAF for every species at each sampling
      location, however this is not always practicable. For example, the
      &lsquo;0.5&rsquo; BAF may be suitable to be used for species x at all
      sampling locations; while the &lsquo;0.1&rsquo; BAF may be required for
      species y at all sampling locations, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      For each species, only use one BAF at each sampling location. Do not make
      separate counts of &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees using different BAFs for the same
      species.

<p>Solutions to problem trees</p>
<ul>
    <li>
      For hidden trees (trees that are partially or fully hidden behind other
      trees or undergrowth), move sideways until the tree is fully in view, but be
      sure to maintain the same distance to the tree. Move back to the sampling
      point before assessing the next tree.
    </li>
    <li>Buttressed trees should be measured above the buttress.</li>
    <li>
      For multi-stemmed trees, measure each stem individually and add all
      &lsquo;in&rsquo; stems to your tally.
    </li>
    <li>
      For trees on a slope, the 1.3 m POM should be measured on the uphill side of
      the tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      For leaning trees, hold the basal wedge at a tilt so that the view is at
      right angles to the trunk or stem.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deformed trees should be measured at the nearest point above 1.3 m that is
      not deformed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dead trees are flagged as &lsquo;Dead&rsquo; and all other attributes are
      measured as normal.
