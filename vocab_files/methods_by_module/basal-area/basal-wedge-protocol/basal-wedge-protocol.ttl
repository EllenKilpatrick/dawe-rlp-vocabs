    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f7e0d965-ae73-434e-8599-634598e506b5">Basal Area</a>" module.

    <ul>
        <li>
          Examples of how to score trees using the TERN Basal Wedge are illustrated in <a href='#figure-8'>Figure 8</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A tree is &lsquo;in&rsquo; when its trunk or stem, at breast height (1.3 m,
          or the nearest point above if there is a deformity at 1.3 m), is wider than
          the chosen BAF (<a href='#figure-8'>Figure 8</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not record the data if less than seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for a given
          BAF are achieved for each species. Data becomes meaningless with less than
          seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees. Repeat the sweep using a smaller BAF, or if
          there are less than seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees with the smallest BAF
          (0.1), no data is recorded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where the trunk or stem is exactly the same width as the BAF (i.e.
          &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; tree), add a half count to your tally (<a href='#figure-8'>Figure 8</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the widest suitable BAF to sample seven &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for
          the species. This increases efficiency as it reduces the numbers of
          &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees likely. For example, use the &lsquo;1&rsquo; BAF to
          record eight &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees rather than the &lsquo;0.5&rsquo; BAF to
          record 15 &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is more efficient to use the same BAF for every species at each sampling
          location, however this is not always practicable. For example, the
          &lsquo;0.5&rsquo; BAF may be suitable to be used for species x at all
          sampling locations; while the &lsquo;0.1&rsquo; BAF may be required for
          species y at all sampling locations, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each species, only use one BAF at each sampling location. Do not make
          separate counts of &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees using different BAFs for the same
          species.

    <ul>
        <li>
          For hidden trees (trees that are partially or fully hidden behind other
          trees or undergrowth), move sideways until the tree is fully in view, but be
          sure to maintain the same distance to the tree. Move back to the sampling
          point before assessing the next tree.
        </li>
        <li>Buttressed trees should be measured above the buttress.</li>
        <li>
          For multi-stemmed trees, measure each stem individually and add all
          &lsquo;in&rsquo; stems to your tally.
        </li>
        <li>
          For trees on a slope, the 1.3 m POM should be measured on the uphill side of
          the tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          For leaning trees, hold the basal wedge at a tilt so that the view is at
          right angles to the trunk or stem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deformed trees should be measured at the nearest point above 1.3 m that is
          not deformed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dead trees are flagged as &lsquo;Dead&rsquo; and all other attributes are
          measured as normal.

        Ensure the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot selection and layout module</a> has been completed to mark out
        the plot grid (including the Centrepoint and north, south, east and west
        point sampling locations) with very high accuracy using the Trimble&reg; R1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the App and navigate to the &lsquo;Basal Area&rsquo; module and then
        the &lsquo;Basal Wedge Protocol&rsquo;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stand at one of the 9 basal wedge sampling locations and
        select the location from the drop-down list. It does not matter
        which order the sampling locations are surveyed in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the &lsquo;Record basal wedge sampling point&rsquo; button to
        record the location with very high accuracy using the Trimble&reg; R1.
        Because the method involves a plotless sweep, location accuracy at the NW,
        N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W points around the perimeter of the plot, as well
        as the center of the plot is not critical.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hold the end knot of the 50 cm length of string attached to the wedge on
        your cheek below one eye &ndash; close the other eye. Hold the wedge so that
        the string is taught (see <a href='#figure-7'>Figure 7</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine if the use of the basal wedge is warranted at the plot (i.e., are
        there sufficient trunks or stems of trees, tall shrubs or mallee that are
        large enough to count seven or more &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees for any species).
      </li>
      <li>
        For each species, establish which BAF (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2) to
        use. This is determined by selecting a BAF and undertaking a brief sweep
        around the point sampling location to determine if the selected BAF will
        sample seven or more &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees (see <a href="#additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</a> below
        for rules on counting &lsquo;in&rsquo; and &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; trees)
        for the sampling location. Ideally aim to achieve the minimum seven
        &lsquo;in&rsquo; trees with the largest aperture width.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have selected the appropriate BAF for a species, rotate through a
        complete 360&deg; sweep and, looking through the eye above the string, count
        the number of stems or trunks of each species, at breast height, that are
        wider than the aperture of the chosen BAF as &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and the exact
        width of the aperture as &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; (i.e., half count).
      </li>
      <li>
        Record the species, the tally of &lsquo;in&rsquo; and
        &lsquo;borderline&rsquo; trees and the BAF used for the sampling location and select the &lsquo;Save
        species&rsquo; button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat 'steps 7&ndash;9' for the remaining species at the sampling location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the &lsquo;Finish sampling location&rsquo; button to return to the
        sampling location selection screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat 'steps 3&ndash;11' at each remaining sampling location. When all the
        sampling locations have been assessed, the App will display a data summary
        (e.g., mean basal area, total stem counts) on the sampling location
        selection screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        When basal area has been recorded for each species at each sampling
        location, select the &lsquo;Finish module&rsquo; button to return to the
        module selection screen.
