<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols </h2>
<p>The Sign-based Fauna Survey Module covers the procedures and
guidelines of five protocols for recording the signs of fauna present in
a project area:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Within-plot belt transect protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Off-plot belt transect protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Plot sign search protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Vehicle track protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Track stations protocol.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The module is appropriate for monitoring all fauna species. However,
the methods outlined have been predominantly used to monitor pest fauna
species, which form the basis of the literature referenced and examples
provided. Depending on the project aims and environment, sign-based
surveys can consist of a single protocol or a combination of the five
protocols. Where possible, sign-based surveys are recommended to be
undertaken within or near an established 1 ha Core Monitoring Plot or
Fauna Plot so that the data to be analysed in combination with
vegetation and landform data collected.</p>
<p><strong>The Within-plot belt transect protocol</strong> is
implemented within the 1 ha plot at 1, 2, 3 or 4 100 m transects
consisting of 100, 1 m x 1 m consecutive quadrats. In each quadrat, the
absence of signs is recorded, or the presence of each sign type along
with the attributed species (minimum data requirement). The number of
each sign type by attributed species can be recorded. In addition, the
protocol can be implemented in unison with the Herbivory and Physical
Damage Module, whereby the extent of physical damage or herbivory is
recorded.</p>
<p><strong>The Off-plot belt transect protocol</strong> is conducted
outside any established plot within the project area. The surveyor can
set the length of off-plot belt transects ranging from 100 m to 5 km.
Similarly, the surveyor can set the length and width of each consecutive
quadrats. Quadrats can be 1 m x 1 m (recommended for densely vegetated
areas or areas with lots of animal activity) and up to 4 m x 20 m
(recommended for more sparsely vegetated communities).</p>
<p><strong>The Plot sign search protocol</strong> involves recording the
presence and age of signs of any fauna observed across the plot (either
2 ha if in arid systems or 1 ha if elsewhere). If a vehicle track is
nearby, an additional 100 m track survey can also be conducted to
supplement the presence records. The active plot sign search protocol is
best suited to sandy environments (either arid or coastal systems) where
tracks can be readily left by animals and where the substrate is not
heavily vegetated or covered in leaf litter to impede tracks being left.
Note this protocol is similar to the Active search protocol of the
Vertebrate Fauna Module, however in this module the focus is on looking
for signs of fauna presence, whilst the Active search protocol allows
for disturbance techniques for searching for fauna present.</p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle tracks protocol</strong> can be undertaken along
a continuous transect which usually comprises a dirt road or vehicle
track. Dirt roads and vehicle tracks are prepared using a heavy object
towed behind a vehicle and revisited on subsequent days to record the
tracks present. Typically track plots are established at set distance
intervals reflecting the target species' home range while ensuring
independence.</p>
<p><strong>The Track stations protocol</strong> can be undertaken within
defined track plots such as sand pads. The track plots are often
prepared and cleared using a broom and revisited on subsequent days to
record the tracks present. Typically track plots are established at set
distance intervals reflecting the target species' home range while
ensuring independence.</p>

    tern:purpose """<p>Sign-based fauna surveys offer an indirect, non-invasive measure of
presence, abundance and impact, and are generally easy to undertake and
require little specialised equipment or training. Sign-based measures
can be particularly useful for cryptic, nocturnal, elusive species or
species that occur in low abundance. In some instances, the signs left
by such species are more conspicuous than the animals themselves
(Mitchell and Balogh 2007d, Claridge 2016, Indigo et al. 2021, Southwell
et al. 2022). Sign-based surveys can be useful when direct observations
of fauna are not required or are difficult to obtain and to supplement
direct survey methods to get a more comprehensive understanding of
distribution and abundance (Hone 1988, Mitchell and Balogh 2007d,
Moriarty and Brown 2012, NPCA 2020).</p>
<p>The Belt transect protocol is based on established methods and has
been adapted here to align with the 1 ha plot, to facilitate
comprehensive data analysis. A variation to the method is also available
and allows a more flexible approach over larger areas, where the user
specifies quadrat width, length, and number (minimum of 10 quadrats).
Longer transects are useful to understand broader scale trends across
the project area (based on the presence of signs) and undertake warren
and den counts.</p>
<p>The 2 ha Arid Zone Monitoring (AZM) approach forms the basis of the
active plot search method, is well established and regularly used to
monitor the presence of arid zone fauna (Indigo et al. 2021). The data
are statistically robust and relatively inexpensive to measure but are
only applicable to monitoring the presence and distribution of fauna
rather than abundance (Southgate and Moseby 2008, Indigo et al. 2021).
The tools and resources developed for the AZM, including a standard data
collection template, workflow, and metadata have been integrated into
this module. The module offers a rapid approach (approximately
30 minutes per 2 ha area), suitable for use in the arid zone and can
document a range of fauna species. The method requires minimal training
and no specialised equipment (Southgate and Moseby 2008, Indigo et al.
2021). A variation to this approach is also available for use in
non-arid systems. It aligns to the 1 ha fauna plot or the vegetation
plot, streamlining data collection where other modules are implemented
simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Track count protocol offers a flexible, simple, cost-effective
(Fleming et al. 2014) and rapid approach (Edwards et al. 2000) for
population monitoring of species that have large home ranges (Wilson and
Delahay 2001). Track counts are effective for detecting cryptic and
elusive species because they do not require direct observation. They
capture the entire active period of a target species (e.g. capable of
detection over an entire 24-hour period) and can be conducted on vehicle
tracks, which can improve efficiency (Read and Eldridge 2010). </p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """<p>Fauna can leave a range of signs in the landscape, and these signs
can be used to detect their presence, quantify their relative abundance
and assess impacts (Cowled and Lapidge 2004, Mitchell and Balogh 2007d,
Engeman et al. 2013). Common signs of fauna include tracks, scats, dens
and burrows, diggings, scratch marks, hair, travel pads, and physical
damage to the environment (vegetation, soil, water) caused by browsing,
rubbing, trampling, rooting, digging, and wallowing (Mitchell and Balogh
2007d, a, e, Engeman et al. 2013, Bradford and Westcott 2015, Higashide
et al. 2021, Hradsky et al. 2021). The Sign-based Fauna Survey Module
provides a standardised approach for surveying fauna signs. The module
is best suited for rabbits, wild dogs, foxes, feral pigs, cats, deer,
and goats, but it can be used for other species of interest, including
camel, horses and non-pest fauna species.</p>
<p>The key attributes recorded during the completion of this module
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Presence/absence of each sign type, and attributable species, for
each quadrat.</p></li>
<li><p>Count of each sign, and attributable species, for each quadrat
(optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Removal of scats once counted in each quadrat, allowing for an
accumulated rate to be surveyed on subsequent revisits
(optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Age of the signs (optional).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Types of fauna signs that should be recorded include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Track</p></li>
<li><p>Scat and dung</p></li>
<li><p>Dung heap</p></li>
<li><p>Nest</p></li>
