    <h3 class="list-paragraph" id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two protocols for
  collecting plant tissue vouchers from within the plot:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Full protocol –leaf samples from a single plant collected for
      <u>all</u> species, with at least five replicate samples collected for the
      dominant perennial species and species targeted in population genetics
      studies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lite protocol – leaf samples from a single plant collected for a subset of
      species being new (i.e. no plant tissue sample from the project area,
      including previous monitoring periods), dominant perennial, unknown,
      important (e.g. data deficient, range extension, uncharacteristic growth
      form), contentious (i.e. disputed or uncertain taxonomy), target (i.e. for
      population genetics studies) and threatened species (unless collection is
      not permitted or will jeopardise the population). At least five replicate
      samples collected for the dominant perennial species and species targeted
      in population genetics studies.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The two protocols include procedures for the placement of the samples into
  synthetic-fibre bags, attachment of voucher labels, entering vouchers into the
  App by scanning the QR code, and maintaining the stored specimens. The
  guidelines provide further information on collection and storage techniques
  and materials.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module is linked to the following
  modules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e"
          >Floristics</a
        ></em
      >
      – The App allows the plant tissue voucher of a species to be recorded
      after the species has been recorded in the <em><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e"
          >Floristics</a
        ></em> module.
      This increases efficiency and ensures plant tissue vouchers are recorded
      into the App using naming consistent to all flora species
      identifications/assigned field names.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821"
          >Plot selection and layout</a
        ></em
      >
      – The plot needs to be laid out before any leaf samples are collected to
      ensure the surveyor remains within the plot boundaries.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32"
          >Plot description</a
        ></em
      >
      – The dominant flora species within each structural layer are recorded in
      the <em>Plot description</em> module and this can help to determine which
      species require replicate plant tissue vouchers to be collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd39a33-9c4f-469e-80a5-e76b5d5f04a6"
          >Opportune</a
        ></em
      >
      – Plant tissue vouchers can be collected from opportunistic observations
      of unknown, important, contentious, target and threatened species.
      Opportune samples can be collected from anywhere across the study area and
      are not restricted to plots.

<p>
  Plant tissue vouchers are collected and stored to enable subsequent molecular
  analyses, including DNA barcoding, population genetics, stable isotope and
  leaf trait analyses. Molecular analysis of plant tissue adds value to
  ecological assessments and monitoring programs as they support accurate plant
  species identification (Nevill <em>et al.</em> 2020), identify genetically
  important populations for conservation and restoration (Hufford
  <em>et al.</em> 2012; Simmons <em>et al.</em> 2018), and detect and provide
  insight into plant-environment interactions (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2018;
  Harada <em>et al.</em> 2020; Munroe <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  Samples are collected into small synthetic-fibre bags as they allow samples to
  dry rapidly (within 12–48 hours) and ensure high quality DNA can be extracted
  (free from impurities). The TERN Ecosystem Surveillance monitoring program
  uses synthetic teabags (<a href='#figure-1'>Figure 1</a>) as they are the perfect size and shape and
  hold together well, with a flap to enclose the sample. Cotton teabags are not
  recommended as there is a risk of contamination from cotton DNA.
  Synthetic-fibre bags containing samples are placed into a shared container
  with silica gel granules, which allows quick and easy replacement of the
  silica gel granules, and also allows the silica gel granules to be dried and
  reused for other purposes. Placing silica gel granules directly into
  individual storage bags is extremely labor intensive to replace and may
  pulverize the leaves through the abrasive action of granules, causing
  contamination and preventing its reuse (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017).

<p>
  DNA barcoding is a system that provides rapid, accurate and automated species
  identifications by using short, standardised gene regions as specific genetic
  markers (Kress <em>et al.</em> 2015). Its rapid growth has led to an increased
  demand for plant tissue samples to be collected and stored appropriately for
  analysis in plant systematics and evolutionary studies (Funk
  <em>et al.</em> 2017; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2020), including studies that have
  developed DNA barcode reference libraries for particular regions in Australian
  (Costion <em>et al.</em> 2016; Nevill <em>et al.</em> 2020). The collection of
  plant tissue samples and expertly identified herbarium voucher specimens
  provides a strong and dynamic taxonomic foundation to establish a DNA barcode
  database of the Australian flora (Dormontt <em>et al.</em> 2018), and
  future-proof the floristic data collected
</p>
<p>
  The collection of plant tissue samples that can be used for DNA barcoding is
  important, particularly for threatened, data deficient and contentious
  species. Plant identification based on morphological diagnosis alone has four
  significant limitations (Hebert <em>et al.</em> 2003): (1) phenotypic
  plasticity and genetic variability in the characters used to distinguish
  species can lead to incorrect identifications; (2) morphologically cryptic
  species, which are common in many groups (Kadereit <em>et al.</em> 2007;
  Sokoloff <em>et al.</em> 2019), can be overlooked; (3) morphological keys are
  often reliant on a particular life stage or gender; and (4) even with modern
  interactive keys, a high level of expertise is often required, meaning
  misidentifications can occur. DNA barcoding is also useful when diagnostic
  features for identification (e.g. leaves, fruit and flowers) are lacking or
  difficult to collect (e.g. for tall forest species where the canopy is out of
  reach; Costion <em>et al.</em> 2016).
</p>
<p>
  In addition to species identification, plant tissue collections can also be
  used to assess genetic diversity within and among plant populations, which has
  important consequences for the composition and function of vegetation
  communities (Hughes <em>et al.</em> 2008). Genetic diversity influences
  species interactions, community structure, population recovery following
  disturbance, functional trait variation and nutrient and energy fluxes
  (Whitham <em>et al.</em> 2006; Hughes <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bell and Gonzalez
  2009). Continental scale plant tissue sampling, to date only undertaken by
  TERN’s Ecosystem Surveillance program (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020), provides
  valuable genetic information on individual species and population connectivity
  and diversity at both fine and broad scales (Hufford <em>et al.</em> 2012;
  Broadhurst <em>et al.</em> 2017). This information is important for modelling
  communities and has the potential to predict which species are more likely to
  become extinct locally (i.e. those that may be already struggling), and which
  are more likely to persevere (Simmons <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Several authors recommend a minimum of 20–30, widely spaced samples per
  population for population genetics studies on plant species (Cavers
  <em>et al.</em> 2005; Sinclair and Hobbs 2009; Hale <em>et al.</em> 2012;
  Ottewell <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the
  <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module, leaf samples from five or more
  individuals of each dominant perennial species are collected from each plot.
  This relatively small number of samples considers that genetic analysis may be
  beyond the scope of many projects, as well as time, budget and sample storage
  restrictions, while ensuring that samples are collected and stored
  appropriately from a large number of populations. The issue of small sample
  sizes is somewhat overcome given that many project areas will contain multiple
  plots and it is likely that the number of samples collected for many species
  from within the entire project area, and potentially the same population for
  depending on the species, will be greater than five. The assignment of
  individuals from across a project area to genetic clusters through genetic
  structure analyses can increase sample sizes for landscape, state-wide or
  continental scale analysis (Christmas <em>et al.</em> 2017). The App allows
  the collection of more than five samples from a single plot for projects with
  a population genetics focus, or where surveyors wish to collect extra samples
  (e.g., if disjunct populations are observed in the field).
</p>
<p>
  Replicate sample collection for population genetics analysis is widely spaced
  within the plot to minimise the risk of sampling closely related individuals
  (Xia <em>et al.</em> 2005; Butcher <em>et al.</em> 2009; Christmas
  <em>et al.</em> 2016; Kireta <em>et al.</em> 2019). The distance to close
  relatives can vary between species/growth forms and should be considered when
  collecting samples. For example, Kireta <em>et al.</em> (2019) did not sample
  nearest neighbours (&lt;2 m) of three <em>Goodenia</em> spp. (understorey
  shrubs), while Christmas <em>et al.</em> (2016) collected
  <em>Dodonaea viscosa</em> ssp. <em>angustissima</em> (tall shrub) samples from
  at least 10 m apart that were not direct neighbours, and Butcher
  <em>et al.</em> (2009) collected <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em> (tree)
  samples from at least 100 m apart. For further information regarding the
  design and implementation of population genetics studies, broad guidelines are
  provided in a number of textbooks (e.g. Lowe <em>et al.</em> 2004; Allendorf
  and Luikart 2013). Standardised methods to address clonality in population
  genetics studies are outlined by Arnaud-Haond <em>et al.</em> (2007).
</p>
<p>
  Stable isotope analysis of key elements essential for plant growth (e.g.,
  carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus) provides insight into several
  ecosystem processes. This includes photosynthesis (Munroe
  <em>et al.</em> 2021), nutrient acquisition and cycling (Reef
  <em>et al.</em> 2014), competition and facilitation (Ens
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), herbivory (Campbell and Vallano 2018), symbiotic
  relationships (Pate <em>et al.</em> 1998), dieback (Harada
  <em>et al.</em> 2020), and biogeography (Andrae <em>et al.</em> 2018).
  Information on processes such as these is valuable for ecological assessment
  and monitoring since it can help to explain the patterns observed in the
  environment and manage negative processes and patterns (e.g. grassy weed
  invasion; Ens <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Plant traits reflect the ecological strategies of flora species, including how
  they respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and
  influence ecosystem properties. Plant trait measurements can therefore be used
  for a wide range of research including evolutionary biology, community and
  functional ecology, and biogeography (Kattge <em>et al.</em> 2011). The
  assessment of plant functional traits across environmental clines provides
  insight into the mechanisms and drivers of trait variation, as well as into
  the persistence and function of widespread species (Hulshof
  <em>et al.</em> 2013; Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Inference can be made for
  these species as to their likely success or failure under future climate
  change and their suitability for revegetation projects (Laughlin 2014). The
  collection of leaf samples in the <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module
  allows for downstream analysis of leaf traits such as specific leaf area, leaf
  area, leaf thickness, photosynthesis and respiration, and nitrogen and
  phosphorous concentration (Pérez-Harguindeguy <em>et al.</em> 2013), all of
  which can provide insight into the conditions observed during ecological
  surveys (e.g. physical signs of stress, morphological and genetic variation).
  For example, specific leaf area and leaf area correlate well with abiotic
  stressors including drought and nutrient availability (Poorter
  <em>et al.</em> 2009).

<p>
  The <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module involves the collection, rapid
  drying and appropriate storage of representative plant tissue (i.e., leaf)
  samples from the vascular flora species within the plot. Plant tissue samples
  are collected to allow for various molecular analyses to be undertaken,
  including DNA barcoding, population genetics, stable isotope and leaf trait
  analyses (Simmons <em>et al.</em> 2018; Dong <em>et al.</em> 2020; Nevill
  <em>et al.</em> 2020; Munroe <em>et al.</em> 2021). Note that molecular
  analysis methods and techniques are not covered by this, or any module in this
  manual.
</p>
<p>
  The plant tissue samples ideally consist of approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of
  young, undamaged leaves (or the best/freshest growth that is on offer) that
  are stored in synthetic-fibre bags (e.g. synthetic teabags) and rapidly dried
  using silica gel granules to preserve the DNA (within 12–48 hours of
  collection; Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module includes two protocols: (1) a full
  protocol in which a plant tissue sample is collected from all species present
  in each plot; and (2) a lite protocol in which a plant tissue sample is
  collected from a subset of the species present in each plot. In both
  protocols, five or more widely spaced replicate samples from the dominant
  perennial species (plus any target species) are collected to facilitate
  population genetics analysis. The full protocol is best practice and
  recommended, particularly for baseline surveys, ‘periodic’ (i.e., every 5–10
  years) repeat monitoring surveys, projects directly involving molecular
  analysis and projects where correct species identification is critical.
</p>
<p>
  The lite protocol may be suitable for use during ‘annual’ repeat monitoring
  surveys in plots where plant tissue samples have been previously collected.
  This is intended to reduce survey time for repeat monitoring surveys, while
  ensuring there are plant tissue samples from key flora species for molecular
  analyses. When implementing the lite protocol, after a plant tissue sample is
  collected at the first instance of each species within the project area, the
  majority of the following instances do not require a plant tissue sample. The
  subset of species that require a plant tissue sample from each plot includes
  new (i.e., no plant tissue sample from the project area, including previous
  monitoring periods), unknown, important (e.g., data deficient, range
  extension, uncharacteristic growth form), contentious (i.e., disputed or
  uncertain taxonomy), target (i.e., for population genetics studies) and
  threatened species (unless collection is not permitted or will jeopardise the
  population).
</p>
<p>
  The plant tissue samples are collected at the same time as the herbarium
  vouchers (see <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a></em> module). A large or separate specimen is
  collected to allow sufficient leaf material for samples for subsequent
  molecular analyses without compromising the herbarium voucher. The two modules
  are linked in the App so that a plant tissue voucher can be labelled with a
  unique QR or barcode and scanned directly into the App after the associated
  herbarium voucher. The voucher labels are available from TERN/DAWE.
