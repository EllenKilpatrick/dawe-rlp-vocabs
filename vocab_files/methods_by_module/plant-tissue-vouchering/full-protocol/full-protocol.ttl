    Leaf samples from a single plant collected for all species, with at least five replicate samples collected for the dominant perennial species and species targeted in population genetics studies.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant tissue vouchering</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant tissue vouchering</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Limit contaminating the plant tissue samples by holding broad-leaf plants
      by the petiole (leaf stem), and grasses by the base of the leaves. Hands
      and secateurs can be cleaned using hand sanitiser and alcohol wipes to
      help limit contamination.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If available, collect young actively growing leaf material that is free
      from damage, disease, insect or fungal contamination. If not available,
      collect the best/freshest growth that is on offer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To ensure enough leaf material is available for analysis (i.e., several
      grams once dried), ensure tea bags are full of the specimen material, and
      consider collecting additional material of fleshy tissue species (e.g.,
      succulent plants).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It can be difficult to confidently identify species with variable leaf
      morphology (e.g., <em>Senna artemisioides</em> ssp.,
      <em>Acacia aneura</em> ssp.). If there appears to be morphologically
      different species in the plot, collect replicate plant tissue samples to
      confirm their identity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ideally all specimens from the plot should fit into a single Sistema® KLlP
      IT™ 2 L or 3 L rectangle container. Pack specimens carefully, whilst
      making use of the available space. If you line the specimens up, rather
      than stacking them, this will help to fit more and makes it easier to sort
      through the collected specimens (see <a href='#figure-4'>Figure 4</a>). Avoid using two containers
      per plot where possible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you run out of synthetic-fibre bags in the field, plant tissue samples
      can be temporarily stored in labelled paper bags, envelopes or within
      folder newspaper (i.e., from your plant press supplies; see
      <em
        ><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e"

        ></em
      >
      module). Store these samples in a separate container with silica gel
      granules so that they can easily be transferred to synthetic-fibre bags
      following the field survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A separate batch of sequential QR code/barcode voucher labels are used for
      each plant tissue voucher, as well as each flora voucher, fauna voucher,
      soil sample and soil metagenomic sample collected. Therefore, care is
      needed to ensure the correct label is being used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When the self-indicating silica gel granules change colour from blue to
      pink, or orange to green, their moisture absorbing capacity has been
      reached and the mix should be replaced with fresh silica gel granules. Do
      not discard the used silica gel granules as it can be oven-dried and
      reused. Drying time in the oven will vary depending on moisture content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Care should be taken when working with silica gel granules as exposure to
      fine silica dust can cause respiratory illness and disease. Although the
      risk of generating silica dust is low, ensure you work in a
      well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable gloves.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you run out of fresh silica gel granules in remote areas, used silica
      gel granules can be dried in a large pot (not used for cooking) on a stove
      or over a fire. Care should be taken not to scorch the desiccant as this
      can cause a loss of moisture capacity and breakdown of the indicator. When
      the indicator granules have returned to their original colour the silica
      gel granules are ready to be reused (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017).

    </p>

      Arrange for delivery of the plant tissue vouchers to TERN/DCCEEW for

      Place used silica gel granules into a cloth bag (e.g. large calico bag,
