    <h3 class="list-paragraph" id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of three protocols for
  establishing photopoints within the plot. The three protocols are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Full protocol (best practice): DSLR panorama – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama
      taken at three photopoints located around the centre of the plot using a
      DSLR camera or high-end mirrorless camera that allows the user to set
      specific camera and lens settings, including focal length and aperture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lite protocol: Compact panorama – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama taken at three
      photopoints located around the centre of the plot using a compact camera
      without the ability to set all the specific camera and lens settings
      required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lite protocol: Device panorama – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama taken at three
      photopoints located around the centre of the plot using a mobile phone or
      tablet.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All three protocols require identifying the plot centre, marking the plot
  centre with a star dropper (or similar, see
  <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout module</a></em>), measuring an equilateral triangle around the centre post to identify the
  locations of the three photopoints (see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>), and taking a
  series of photos to create a 360<sup>o</sup> panorama. The three protocols
  only differ in the camera used, and integration of the app.
</p>
<p>
  The guidelines provide further specific information and justification for the
  camera and equipment settings, and tips for obtaining high quality, accurate
  photos suitable for a visual reference of the plot and processing into a 3D
  reconstruction of the vegetation within the plot. The latter can be used to
  monitor changes over time to track plot condition, as well as providing unique
  and fast measurements of basal area and biomass.
</p>
<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout module</a></em>
      – The plot needs to be have been laid out before commencing the
      photopoints module. If the plot was laid out on a previous survey, the
      centre post needs to be located before commencing the photopoints module.
      A GPS/GNSS may be required to assist locating the centre post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Interventions</em> – Whilst not developed yet, it is expected the
      Interventions module will have direct links to the Photopoints module as
      additional photopoints may be established within key locations of a
      project area where interventions are taking place.

    <h3 class="list-paragraph" id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Ground-based photos are a key component of environmental surveys as they
  provide a visual reference of a plot at the time of the survey (Pickard 2002),
  and repeat plot photos provide important qualitative data for long-term
  ecological monitoring (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2010). In addition, plot photos
  allow stakeholders (or others that were not involved in the on-ground survey)
  to visually perceive the study site and better understand plot descriptions
  and data.
</p>
<p>
  The major advantages of photogrammetry using ground-based photo-panoramas
  include the low cost, portability and ease of operation (for non-specialist
  field surveyors) of the equipment. In contrast, Terrestrial Laser Scanning
  (TLS) instruments used to collect lidar (light detection and ranging) data,
  which have been used successfully to highly accurately characterise vegetation
  structure attributes, require a significant upfront cost and have reduced
  portability.

<p>
  This Photopoints module outlines the steps to take a series of photos of the
  plot to collect monitoring data. When the photos are taken following the
  protocols outlined in this module, the photos provide not only a
  high-resolution visual reference of the plot at the time of the survey, but
  also enable a three-dimensional reconstruction of the plot. This transforms
  the ‘static’ photos into actual monitoring data able to be interrogated for
  changes at the plot over time, and assessed against management outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  Photopoint monitoring is typically used to record and monitor environmental
  change over time and involves taking periodic photos from a fixed, permanently
  marked locations (Pickard 2002; O’Connor and Bond 2007). This method allows
  environmental change to be quickly and effectively documented, is inexpensive,
  and does not require specialised skills or training (Hall 2002). However,
  photos are typically taken, and kept as records for visual reference only,
  enabling before, during and after transformation visualisations, that can
  support field collected measures, but the downfall is that they do not
  generate actual data.
</p>
<p>
  Photo panoramas (a single panorama, or a series of photos stitched together to
  form a single wide angle photo up to 360<sup>o</sup>), are increasingly being
  collected during photopoint monitoring (Department of Planning Industry and
  Environment 2020; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020), and can be used to capture an
  entire landscape or monitoring plot, while maintaining image detail (Nichols
  <em>et al.</em> 2009). Image processing software is used to stitch overlapping
  images together to depict a field of view considerably wider (up to 360°) than
  one that can be captured in a single exposure (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).
  At present, even low cost, amateur digital cameras and mobile phone cameras
  can produce auto or semiauto photo-panoramas (Nichols <em>et al.</em> 2009).
  In addition, photogrammetry, which allows a three-dimensional model to be
  constructed from two-dimensional images (Muir 2018), can be undertaken using
  ground-based photo panoramas, and this can be used for measurements of
  vegetation structure attributes (Liang <em>et al.</em> 2014; Morgenroth and
  Gómez 2014; Muir 2018).
</p>
<p>
  In the review of 30 Regional Land Partnerships projects that were investigated
  to identify the types of ecological monitoring methods employed, just four
  projects were taking representative photos of the vegetation units within the
  project area, five took representative photos of monitoring plots, and 10 were
  taking photos of the monitoring points across the project area that were not
  necessarily related to areas where direct measures were taken (TERN 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The aim of the Photopoints module is to provide a method than enables the
  collection of high resolution photos from the plot to enable three-dimensional
  point-cloud reconstruction of the plot (see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> for an example), and
  enable algorithms to be applied to create data on biomass, carbon, and basal
  area of the plot, relatively cheaply, yet relatively scientifically accurate.
  The photopoints should be established as soon as possible once a project
  commences (if not earlier) to gain baseline photos and data. The intervals of
  repeating the photopoints depends on the goals of the project and the
  logistics of re-visiting the plot. Photos should be taken at least every 12
  months (i.e. at approximately the same month each year). Shorter periods, e.g.
  3 – 6 months are useful for identifying seasonal changes. Implementing the
  photopoints module, in either of the three protocols specified, future proofs
  the project and dataset, enabling the application of future post-processing
  analysis techniques to generate data we are currently not aware of.
