      Familiarise yourself with the device and the default camera, and refer to
      the device manual (online tutorials, help options etc.) to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Ensure the date and time are correct</p></li>
      <li><p>Photo quality is set to the highest available</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Change camera modes, from standard photos to panorama photos</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Turn off ‘scan QR codes’ automatically (if left on, this could get
          annoying if the camera starts picking up the QR codes in the
          calibration target)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If available, select ‘RAW copies’ to save JPEG and RAW copies of
          pictures when taken in Pro mode
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Turn on grid lines (to help keep the camera horizontal (on flat ground
          at least), when a tripod is not being used.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Always ensure 100 MB is spare storage on the mobile device before starting
      to avoid the capacity being reached part-way through the survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine where on your body 1.4 m from the ground is – this is the height
      you will aim to hold the mobile device camera lens at whilst taking the
      panoramas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If conducting the photopoints module at a plot that has already been
      previously established using procedures and guidelines in
      <em>Plot layout and positioning module</em>, check that the module was
      fully completed and that the centre post used for the photopoint was
      installed. If not, ensure you have a star dropper available for when you
      visit the plot to take the photos.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-collection-2">Field collection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the start of each survey, check the camera settings to ensure the
      correct date and time. Date and time may be used to cross-reference photos
      against the app data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the device has the ability, ensure GPS location settings are enabled
      (optional setting, and not a requirement).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The photo sequences should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where
      possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure
      good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these
      times if there is reasonable light, and the light is diffused (i.e.
      consistent cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some communities where the vegetation is very dense, it may not be
      possible to obtain useful panoramas as the vegetation is in close
      proximity to the camera giving little or no depth to the photo. Still take
      the panoramas, but also take other photos of the plot, including
      representative photos in cardinal compass directions (in the sequence of
      due north, south, east, west) of the community as a reference for the
      plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some communities where dense vegetation prohibits a clear field of
      view, or where the landscape prohibits the positioning of the star dropper
      (i.e. due to a large boulder right at the plot centre), the photopoint
      star dropper may be relocated off-centre. This should be no more than 10 m
      from the actual centre point, and the location must be updated in the Plot
      layout and positioning module (ideally this would have been considered
      when the plot was being established, not as an afterthought once the
      photopoints were being conducted).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="post-field-survey-2">Post-field survey</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photos must not be edited, cropped, or have watermarks or filters applied.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      File names should not be re-named from the default camera name assigned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Properties/EXIF metadata of the photos should not be edited, i.e. date,
      time and GPS locations (if applicable), should not be altered with,
      however additional data may be added.

<p>
  TERN has designed and developed a calibration target. Use of the calibration
  target in the photo panoramas aids processing the photos. The procedures below
  include detail on how to construct the calibration target and a holder to
  ensure it is safe transport (recommended for use when field work is conducted
  over extended periods, and when off-road driving is required).

  Materials and equipment for the calibration target:

    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Push-on cap – 90 mm diameter</p></li>

  <strong>Printing note:</strong> The calibration target code sheet consists of
  a series of QR codes that the computer software reads. The sheet is designed
  so certain codes wrap around the 90 mm target pipe. The sheet must be printed
  at full scale, and the edges trimmed to the dotted line. The target code sheet
  once trimmed needs to measure 282 mm (= circumference of the 90 mm pipe) so
  that the codes match up precisely.

      Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly south, use
      a compass (or app) to ensure accuracy as this has implications for the
      image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the dropper into
      position so that the top is 1.3 m above ground level. Ideally, the central
      star dropper should remain as a permanent marker to ensure repeated

      Position the calibration target over the central star dropper. There is no
      start/end to the target QR code sequence, so there is no need be concerned
      with how it faces each pointpoint. However, it is important that the
      calibration target remains in the exact same position for each of the
      three pointpoints. If it is windy, consider taping the bottom to the star
      dropper so it does not wobble.
