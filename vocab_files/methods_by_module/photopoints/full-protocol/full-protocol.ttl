<h4>Appendix 1. Instructions to construct a calibration target</h4>
<h5 id="calibration-target-3">Calibration target</h5>
<p>
  TERN has designed and developed a calibration target. Use of the calibration
  target in the photo panoramas aids processing the photos. The procedures below
  include detail on how to construct the calibration target and a holder to
  ensure it is safe transport (recommended for use when field work is conducted
  over extended periods, and when off-road driving is required).
</p>
<h5 id="materials-and-equipment-for-the-calibration-target">
  Materials and equipment for the calibration target:
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      PVC pipe – 90 mm diameter cut to a minimum 250 mm length, ideally 540 mm
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Push-on cap – 90 mm diameter</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A4 paper, preferably in off-white, light cream, light grey, light green
      (any light colours other than bright white works best)

  <strong>Printing note:</strong> The calibration target code sheet consists of
  a series of QR codes that the computer software reads. The sheet is designed
  so certain codes wrap around the 90 mm target pipe. The sheet must be printed
  at full scale, and the edges trimmed to the dotted line. The target code sheet
  once trimmed needs to measure 282 mm (= circumference of the 90 mm pipe) so
  that the codes match up precisely.

<p>The following equipment is required to take the photo panoramas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      DSLR camera with a 15 megapixel or greater sensor and able to shoot in RAW
      format, with either a 24 mm fixed lens or zoom lens set at 24 mm focal
      length
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Operational manual for the camera</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Spare batteries for camera, or ability to recharge batteries in the field
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Memory cards (either SD or compact flash depending on the camera
      requirements), minimum 8 GB capacity per plot
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tripod that enables the camera to be set to a height where the centre of
      the lens sits at 1.3 m, ideally with a built-in bubble spirit level to
      ensure the camera is level
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Calibration target (preferred, optional)</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Coloured tape (or similar) for marking the star dropper (any colour) or
      holding the calibration in place if its windy
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>5 m tape measure</p></li>
  <li><p>3 tent pegs (ideally) or 3 clothes pegs</p></li>
  <li><p>Mobile device (tablet/phone) with the App installed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  For installing the centre post (refer to
  <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>DGPS/GNSS</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Star dropper (1.8 m in length so it can be positioned to a height of 1.3
      m)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fence post driver or mallet (for positioning the star dropper) (should
      have been completed as part of the
      <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="specifications-and-advice">Specifications and advice</h4>
<h5 id="camera">Camera</h5>
<p>TERN typically use the following camera and lens models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Canon EOS 550D DSLR cropped sensor camera, with 18-200 mm zoom lens set at
      24 mm focal length. For cropped sensor cameras similar to this, aim for a
      50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence. Completing the full
      360<sup>o</sup> panorama should take around 22 photos.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Canon EOS 6D Mark II full frame DSLR camera, with a Canon EF 24-70 mm zoom
      lens set at 24 mm focal length. For full frame cameras like this, aim for
      50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence, just like if using a
      cropped sensor camera, but expect less photos to be required. Completing
      the full 360<sup>o</sup> panorama should take around 16 photos.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Make sure to familiarise yourself with the camera before the field survey
  commences and take the camera manual with you into the field for reference if
  needed. You will need to know how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>check and change the date and time</p></li>
  <li><p>change the file format to shoot in RAW+JPEG</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      change the camera mode to Auto and Aperture priority (Av mode if using a
      Canon; mode names will vary between makes, use your manual for reference)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>change the aperture to F11 (f stop)</p></li>
  <li><p>adjust the lens focal length to 24 mm</p></li>
  <li><p>change the lens from auto-focus to manual focus</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      mount the camera on the tripod, adjust the tripod height, and check that
      the tripod is evenly balanced (preferably by reading the spirit level if
      one is fitted on the tripod).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="memory-cards">Memory cards</h5>
<p>
  Choose a SD or compact flash card (depending on your camera requirements) with
  a high camera write-speed, such as a SanDisk Extreme Pro or Lexar
  Professional. The faster the write-speed, the less time wasted waiting for the
  camera to be ready between taking the photos. USB read speed (copying the
  files to the computer) is of less importance. TERN typically uses SanDisk
  Extreme Pro 128GB SDXC (which have a 170MB/s transfer speed).
</p>
<h5 id="calibration-target">Calibration target</h5>
<p>
  TERN has designed and developed a calibration target (see Figure 4 below). Use
  of the calibration target in the panoramas aids processing the photos but is
  not critical. The procedures below include detail on how to use the
  calibration target, and what to do when the target is not used. Instructions
  on constructing the calibration target are provided in Appendix 1.

      Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly south, use

      that the top is 1.3 m above ground level. Ideally, the central star
      dropper should remain as a permanent marker to ensure repeated sampling is
      precisely the same.

      Position the calibration target over the central star dropper. There is no

      with how it faces each pointpoint. However, it is important that the
      calibration target remains in the exact same position for each of the
      three pointpoints. If it is windy, consider taping the bottom to the star

            set the lens focus to auto, take a test image in the direction of
            the sun and view it on the screen to ensure the image is correctly
            exposed. If overexposed, increase the shutter speed until the image
            is suitable. If too dark, slow the shutter speed until the image is
            suitable.

            Delete the test image(s). Note: low shutter speeds will mean that
            the camera must be kept very stable when taking photos to avoid
            blurring.

      Adjust the camera angle slightly to the left of the calibration target
      looking directly at the vegetation behind the target. While the lens is
      still set to auto focus, half depress the shutter button so the camera
      focuses on the vegetation, and the calibration target will now be slightly
      out of focus (see Figure 10 for examples). No need to take a photo at this
      step. Retain this focus and continue to the next step.

      Switch the lens to manual focus (maintaining the same focus as for the

      commencing on the calibration target. Ensure the camera remains level,
      with the same proportion of sky to ground is maintained as in the previous
