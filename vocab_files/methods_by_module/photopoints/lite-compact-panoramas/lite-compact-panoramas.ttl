      Familiarise yourself with the camera, and refer the cameras manual to
      change the date and time, change the file format to RAW+JPEG, change the
      camera mode to aperture priority, set the aperture (f stop), and set the
      lens focal length.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If conducting the photopoints module at a plot that has already been
      previously established using procedures and guidelines in
      <em>Plot layout and positioning module</em>, check that the module was
      fully completed and that the centre post used for the photopoint was
      installed. If not, ensure you have a star dropper available for when you
      visit the plot to take the photos.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-collection-1">Field collection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the start of each survey, check the camera settings to ensure the
      correct date and time. Date and time may be used to cross-reference photos
      against the app data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera has the ability, ensure GPS location settings are enabled
      (optional setting, and not a requirement).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The photo sequences should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where
      possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure
      good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these
      times if there is reasonable light, and the light is diffused (i.e.
      consistent cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some communities where the vegetation is very dense, it may not be
      possible to obtain useful panoramas as the vegetation is in close
      proximity to the camera giving little or no depth to the photo. Still take
      the panoramas, but also take other photos of the plot, including
      representative photos in cardinal compass directions (in the sequence of
      due north, south, east, west) of the community as a reference for the
      plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some communities where dense vegetation prohibits a clear field of
      view, or where the landscape prohibits the positioning of the star dropper
      (i.e. due to a large boulder right at the plot centre), the photopoint
      star dropper may be relocated off-centre. This should be no more than 10 m
      from the actual centre point, and the location must be updated in the Plot
      layout and positioning module (ideally this would have been considered
      when the plot was being established, not as an afterthought once the
      photopoints were being conducted).

      File names should not be re-named from the default camera name assigned.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      Properties/EXIF metadata of the photos should not be edited, i.e. date,

<p>
  TERN has designed and developed a calibration target. Use of the calibration
  target in the photo panoramas aids processing the photos. The procedures below
  include detail on how to construct the calibration target and a holder to
  ensure it is safe transport (recommended for use when field work is conducted
  over extended periods, and when off-road driving is required).

  Materials and equipment for the calibration target:
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>

  <strong>Printing note:</strong> The calibration target code sheet consists of
  a series of QR codes that the computer software reads. The sheet is designed
  so certain codes wrap around the 90 mm target pipe. The sheet must be printed
  at full scale, and the edges trimmed to the dotted line. The target code sheet
  once trimmed needs to measure 282 mm (= circumference of the 90 mm pipe) so
  that the codes match up precisely.

      Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly south, use
      a compass (or app) to ensure accuracy as this has implications for the
      image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the dropper into
      position so that the top is 1.3 m above ground level. Ideally, the central

      Position the calibration target over the central star dropper. There is no

      calibration target remains in the exact same position for each of the
      three pointpoints. If it is windy, consider taping the bottom to the star

      set the focus to auto, take a test image in the direction of the sun and
      view it on the screen to ensure the image is correctly exposed. If
      overexposed, increase the shutter speed until the image is suitable. If
      too dark, slow the shutter speed until the image is suitable.

      Delete the test image(s). Note: low shutter speeds will mean that the
      camera must be kept very stable when taking photos to avoid blurring.

      Adjust the camera angle slightly to the left of the calibration target
      looking directly at the vegetation behind the target. While still set to
      auto focus, half depress the shutter button so the camera focuses on the
      vegetation, and the calibration target will now be slightly out of focus.
      No need to take a photo at this step. Retain this focus and continue to
      the next step.

      Switch the focus to manual (maintaining the same focus as for the last
      step) and commence the panorama sequence, with the first image commencing
      on the calibration target. Ensure the camera remains level, with the same
      proportion of sky to ground is maintained as in the previous photo. Check

      Take a sequence of photos to cover the 360° panorama rotating the camera
      in a clockwise direction, finishing back looking at the calibration
      target. Ensure a minimum 50% overlap between successive photos. The full
      360 panorama should require around 20-30 photos depending on your camera.
