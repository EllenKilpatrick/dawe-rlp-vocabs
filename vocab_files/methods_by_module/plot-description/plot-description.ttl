<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Landform and Land Surface <br />- Plot description information should be collected at the end of the plot survey when the observer is familiar with the landscape and plant species have been identified or assigned a field name in the Floristics Module. <br />- For an overview and short description of the different landform and lithology classes refer to the Landform and Land Surface Resources at the end of this module or click on the info buttons within the app. <br />- The slope class is derived from the degree value entered and is automatically populated by the app. Slope class can help inform landform element, so slope information should be collected before the landform element field is populated. <br />- Slope can be measured with a clinometer, a compass or a suitable app. Refer to the supporting Landform and Land Surface Resources information at the end of this module for tips on measuring slope. <br />- If down slope is measured, slope and aspect can be recorded from the same position. <br />- If using a clinometer, ensure that slope is recorded in degrees and not as a percent. Slope should be measured as precisely as possible. <br />- Aspect is the orientation of the down slope and can be recorded to the nearest 5 or 10 degrees. Refer to the supporting Landform and Land Surface Resources information at the end of this module for information on measuring aspect. <br />- If the observer is not confident determining lithology in the field, this information can be sourced from relevant spatial datasets for the region. This information should be reviewed before the field survey and a copy taken to the field to assist with the lithology classification. <br />- To assist with lithology classification, refer to the info buttons within the app, which include photos for all the different lithology types.</p>
<p>Vegetation <br />- Vegetation structural information is derived from the dominant growth form, height and cover for the association. Refer to the Vegetation Resources at the end of this module for a matrix of all potential options. All options are listed in the drop-down menu. If unsure, assign after the Structural Formation once the NVIS Level 5 description has been completed. <br />- The homogeneity measure is a record of the visual estimate (in metres) of the shortest distance from the plot centre to a vegetation association different to the one being sampled. Where there is uncertainty, it is recommended that this measure be an underestimate (better to be conservative when estimating the distance). <br />- Where it is not possible to directly observe the distance to a different association (e.g. goes over dune crest), estimate the furthest distance that you are sure is within the same association (i.e. as far as you can still see the vegetation association from the point you are standing). <br />- Vegetation information is collected that is consistent with the association level (Level 5) of the NVIS. Enter up to three dominant species for each stratum, where present. Information does not need to be entered for all species or all stratum. For example, if the association only has two dominant ground storey species and no upper or mid storey, then information only needs to be entered for G1 and G2. <br />- Refer to the supporting Vegetation Resources information, which includes vegetation structural diagrams for different vegetation communities. <br />- For a list of growth forms, height classes and cover codes, refer to the Vegetation Resources at the end of this module or click on the info button within the app. <br />- The following growth forms are allowed for each stratum: <br />- Upper &ndash; trees, tree mallee. <br />- Middle &ndash; shrubs, low trees, mallee shrubs, tall grasses, grass trees. <br />- Ground &ndash; grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, lichens, low shrubs, ferns, grass trees. <br />- Only species that fall into the growth forms associated with each stratum will be available in the drop-down list for that layer (i.e. only species classified as trees or tree mallees can be selected from the upper story species lists). <br />- Once the NVIS information has been entered based on individual species and stratum, the app (or database) will generate the NVIS Level 5 description. It is good practice to review this description and if needed, make any amendments to the data entered, before clicking Save. <br />- If necessary, you can amend the vegetation information after clicking Save by using the Edit function. <br />- The NVIS Level 5 description can be cross-checked against the association descriptions from the Cover module.</p>""" ;
