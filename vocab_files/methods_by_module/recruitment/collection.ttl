    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two protocols for
  recording age class structure and survivorship at the plot:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Age class protocol – consists of 3 sub-protocols to undertake (1) growth
      stage and life-stage surveys at the plot level, (2) seedling and sapling
      counts within belt transects and (3) small trees surveys within belt
      transects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Survivorship protocol – allows users to tag individual plants with a
      unique ID, record location, health and life-stage, and record size
      measurements for individual plants.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Recruitment</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Plot Description</em> - recruitment data should be assessed in
      combination with climate and disturbance data collected as part of the
      <em>Plot Description</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Condition</em> – recruitment is assessed as part of the
      <em>Condition</em> module. If the condition module is undertaken, the age
      class structure protocol (life-stage, seedling and sapling counts, small
      tree survey) needs to be completed. The survivorship protocol does not
      form part of the <em>Condition</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Cover</em> – a subset of the point intercept transects form the basis
      for the belt transects used to record seedling and sapling counts and to
      undertake the small tree survey. The <em>Recruitment</em> module should be
      completed after <em>Cover</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Floristics</em> – the <em>Floristics</em> module needs to be completed
      before any recruitment data can be collected. Recruitment data can only be
      entered against the species or field names defined in the
      <em>Floristics</em> module. Species lists collected during floristics will
      be filtered to remove any annual species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Interventions</em> – can be used to assess age class structure before
      and after interventions, and survival after interventions, including
      restoration and translocation.

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Recruitment is an indicator of ecosystem health as it shows processes such as
  pollination are occurring, soil conditions are suitable for vulnerable
  juvenile plants and grazing pressure is within acceptable limits (Department
  of Environment and Conservation 2012). The on-going absence of seedlings
  and/or juvenile plants can be a sign that ecosystem processes have been
  disrupted, particularly if climatic conditions have been favourable for
  germination, and this can limit the long-term survival of species in the
  landscape (Casson et al. 2009). Land management practices, such as burning or
  grazing, and natural processes, such as drought, can affect the processes
  required for regeneration and recruitment (Fischer et al. 2009; Eyre et al.
  2015). Consequently, understanding how landscape changes and management
  activities affect population processes, is critical for developing
  conservation strategies and successfully managing natural resources
  (Broadhurst &amp; Young 2006).
</p>
<p>
  Growth stage and life-stage are recorded across the plot to provide an
  overview of recruitment and age class structure (e.g. recruiting, mature,
  senescent), and potential to recruit (presence of reproductive material) for
  all perennial species present (as identified in the
  <em>Floristics</em> module). Multiple growth and life-stages can be recorded
  for each species. Adequate recruitment for each perennial species is also
  determined, based on the Habitat Hectares approach from Victoria (Department
  of Sustainability and Environment 2004) and the TASVEG guidelines (Michaels
  2006).
</p>
<p>
  Seedling and sapling counts are undertaken to get an estimate of the number of
  recruits for tree and shrub species present, with counts undertaken on a per
  species basis, where possible (Department of Conservation 2019). Seedlings and
  saplings can be difficult to identify, so recording to genus level or as a
  generic tree or shrub is also allowed, where further identification is not
  possible. Small tree surveys, which record the location, species (or genus),
  size and life-stage of individuals present are also undertaken, to help
  document age class structure, and assist with the interpretation of changes
  that occur over time (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012).
</p>
<p>
  Due to the small size of new recruits, area based sampling methods are more
  appropriate than transects, with larger sampling areas providing a more
  representative sample, but are also more labour intensive to undertake
  (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012). Consequently, 2 m belt
  transects have been selected as the most suitable sampling method for the
  seedling and sapling counts, and the small tree survey, as they facilitate
  systematic surveys, and allow good coverage of the plot, while minimising the
  amount of area that needs to be surveyed. Two metre wide transects have been
  utilised in other Australian studies to assess recruitment dynamics (Romanin
  et al. 2019). The belt transects align with the five north-south point
  intercept transects from the <em>Cover</em> module to increase field survey
  efficiency, reduce any bias associated with landscape features and maintain
  coverage over the plot. The width of the belt transects will be defined with
  the point-intercept staff, to increase sampling efficiency and avoid laying
  out additional tapes to define survey areas. Using a pole or staff to define
  survey areas has been used successfully for other survey and monitoring
  activities (DENR 2011).
</p>
<p>
  The survivorship protocol is optional and flexible, with survey area and
  target species determined by the user, depending on the project aims. The
  location of individual plants will be recorded and each individual will be
  tagged, allowing repeat measures of health and growth to be undertaken over
  time. Individuals can be tagged and tracked using belt transects, the plot or
  population extent. The survivorship protocol allows users to track selected
  individuals, a single target species, multiple target species or all species
  present.

<p>
  Recruitment is critical to the development, succession, and maintenance of
  plant populations (Casson et al. 2009; Bailey et al. 2012), and species need
  to be able to successfully produce new generations of plants if they are to
  remain viable in the long term (Department of Environment and Conservation
  2012). For recruitment to occur, there needs to be sufficient seed supply and
  rainfall to trigger germination, and following this, suitable conditions
  (light, temperature, nutrients) are required to support the establishment and
  development of seedlings (Bailey et al. 2012), with optimal conditions
  differing between species (Casson et al. 2009). As a result, the recruitment
  of many tree and shrub species can be infrequent and episodic (Michaels 2006).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Recruitment</em> module will allow users to collect a range of
  information about recruitment, including life-stages of each perennial species
  present (to assess level of recruitment and potential to recruit), seedling
  and sapling counts for woody species, and small tree surveys, to assess age
  class structure. A survivorship option is also available to track survival,
  growth, health and life-stages of individual plants over time. Survivorship is
  optional but it has a range of applications, including monitoring restoration
