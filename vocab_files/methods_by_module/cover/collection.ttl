<h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two protocols for
  recording cover within the plot:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    
      <p>
        <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/576f634e-2706-4f18-b561-0636d4c007d0">Full protocol</a> – cover recorded from 1010 point-intercepts across the
        plot for all intercepts from the ground to the canopy, including
        substrate, species, growth form and height.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/aa1525f9-c3f2-4f7d-98cc-6a7d3aec9d8a">Lite protocol</a> – cover recorded from 404 point-intercepts across the plot
        for all intercepts from the ground to the canopy, including substrate,
        species, growth form and height.
      </p>
    
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The full protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for setting up ten
  100 m transects (5 x N/S and 5 x E/W), recording the transect being assessed
  and in which direction, recording point-intercept data, including substrate,
  species, growth form, height and canopy data, at 1 m intervals along the ten
  transects located across the plot (for a total of 1010 points), and entering
  the data directly into the App. The guidelines provide further information on
  using a laser pointer to determine hits and the GRS Densitometer™ to view
  canopy intercepts, the rules for determining a ‘hit’, and when to apply ‘In
  Canopy Sky’.
</p>
<p>
  The lite protocol includes procedures and guidelines similar to the full
  protocol, except the guidelines provide instructions for setting up four 100 m
  transects (2 x N/S and 2 x E/W) and recording data at 1 m intervals along the
  four transects located across the plot (for a total of 404 points).
</p>
<p>The <em>Cover</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Site selection and plot layout</a></em>
        – The point-intercept transect grid is aligned to the plot defined
        boundaries.
      </p>

</ul>
<p>
  Rainforests, tall eucalypt forests and vine thickets provide some challenges
  to the use of the point-intercept method (Sparrow et al. 2020). This is
  because the identification and distinction of tall trees can be difficult, and
  the vegetation in vine thickets can be too dense to lay out and survey
  transects. Use of TERN’s forest specific protocols may be more appropriate in
  these systems (Wood et al. 2015).

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Vegetation cover is an essential variable for any ecological assessment or
  surveillance monitoring program (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is required
  for the study, analysis, reporting and management of ecosystem condition,
  structure, and change. Substrate cover can also be an important measure for a
  range of studies, including assessments of soil stabilisation, biological soil
  crusts, erosion, litter heterogeneity, nutrient input and cycling, and
  compressional disturbances (Andrew and Lange 1986a; Facelli and Carson 1991;
  Belnap and Gillette 1998; Shen <em>et al.</em> 2011; Li <em>et al.</em> 2014).
  Consequently, adequate sampling effort and quantitative, accurate and
  repeatable measures of vegetation and substrate cover are paramount for field
  assessments, which are achievable following the point-intercept method
  outlined in this module.
</p>
<p>
  Methods for evaluating vegetation cover in rangelands have been extensively
  trialed and reviewed for both monitoring (Lodge and Gleeson 1976; Friedel and
  Shaw 1987; Watson and Novelly 2004) and remote sensing validation (Zhou
  <em>et al.</em> 1998). While no single method is optimal for all vegetation
  communities, the point-intercept method is the most repeatable and precise
  method to assess vegetation cover for all strata (Vittoz and Guisan 2007;
  Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bonham 2013). The method is
  straightforward, repeatable and allows for detailed spatial and temporal
  comparisons of cover between plot samples with minimal uncertainty from
  measurement method or observer variation (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017).
</p>
<p>
  The point-intercept method is preferred over estimating cover visually using
  cover classes (e.g. Braun-Blanquet 1932), which can be biased, imprecise and
  poor at detecting change (Vittoz and Guisan 2007; Godínez-Alvarez
  <em>et al.</em> 2009). At each point-intercept the only decision is whether
  the laser beam intersects the substrate, species or lifeform, or a canopy hit
  is recorded using the densitometer, which minimises observer error and
  variability (Vittoz and Guisan 2007; Clarke 2009). The use of cover classes in
  visual estimates is problematic since classes are often too broad (e.g.
  25-50%) to identify and analyse subtle changes in cover, limiting their
  ability to identify more subtle environmental change. However, this can be
  achieved using the point intercept method (e.g. Brady <em>et al.</em> 1995).
  The transect point-intercept method is also used in favour over other
  point-intercept methods that are less straightforward, accurate and applicable
  to all systems, and more prone to bias. The wheel-point point-intercept method
  (Tidmarsh and Havenga 1955) is impracticable in systems with an overstorey or
  dense understorey (Walker 1970), and the step-pointing point-intercept method
  is prone to low precision between observers due to different paces and poorly
  defined transects (Evans and Love 1957).
</p>
<p>
  Several authors recommend a minimum of 1,000 point-intercepts to quantify
  vegetation cover per species in rangeland environments (Lodge and Gleeson
  1976; Holm <em>et al.</em> 1984; Friedel and Shaw 1987; Vittoz and Guisan
  2007). Rangeland environments represent 81% of the terrestrial ecosystems in
  Australia and include a diverse range of habitats and ecological communities
  such as tropical savannas, woodlands, shrublands and grasslands (Department of
  Agriculture‚ Water and the Environment 2021). These factors are the basis for
  the <em>Cover</em> module’s full protocol sampling 1,010 point-intercepts to
  estimate vegetation cover per species across the plot. The full protocol is
  also based on the point-intercept protocol initiated in Australia’s rangeland
  environments by the TERN Ecosystem Surveillance monitoring program (White
  <em>et al.</em> 2012), which has since been implemented successfully in a wide
  variety of structurally diverse vegetation communities across the country
  (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). Visualisations of raw point-intercept data
  from 442 plots collected as part of this program demonstrate that the number
  and arrangement of point-intercepts employed is adequate for maximising
  species detection and for stable estimation of cover, in that estimates of
  species richness and cover become relatively stable by 1010 hits (Guerin
  <em>et al.</em> 2017).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Cover</em> module’s lite protocol samples 404 point-intercepts.
  Species data is collected at each point-intercept to maintain data standards.
  However, vegetation cover per species is not reliable from 404 points.
  Cumulative cover estimates for individual species within each plot are
  relatively unstable with fewer intercepts (i.e. cover estimates change quickly
  with the addition of samples), while estimates stabilise with the full set of
  1010 point-intercepts (i.e. additional samples do not change the estimates;
  Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017). For this reason, the lite protocol is not
  suitable for studies that require reliable measures of cover per species, but
  it may be suitable in studies where interpreting cover per growth form or
  fractional cover. Data from 404 point-intercepts is appropriate to detect
  overall change but can’t reliably identify what is causing that change, unlike
  the full protocol which samples 1010 point-intercepts.
</p>
<p>
  Data is collected using a grid configuration, which is less sensitive to the
  effects that local heterogeneity (e.g. due to slope) and micro-patterning of
  the vegetation may have on estimates of cover (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2020), which are difficult to avoid in rangeland environments
  (Vetter 2005). Transect ends are at least initially located and recorded with
  a Trimble® R1 (configured with the GNSS Status app) to ensure that transects
  can be relocated with a high level of accuracy, which ensures detection on
  true environmental change rather than change due to the positioning of the
  transects. A graduated staff is used to measure the height of vegetation at
  each point-intercept, which reduces observer bias and provides a
  three-dimensional insight of the structure of the vegetation within the plot,
  further improving upon traditional vegetation survey methods. A
  downward-pointing laser mounted on the staff to mark each intercept removes
  observer bias. The use of a densitometer, ensures canopy cover data is
  precise, objective and repeatable between observers. The inclusion of ICS
  allows for vegetation cover measures including opaque canopy cover and
  projected foliage cover to be determined from the point-intercept data. Such
  compatibility maximises the value of the point-intercept data, allowing it to
  be used and easily combined with other studies for both ecological and remote
  sensing validation purposes.
</p>
<p>
  The point-intercept method is designed to sample the composition and structure
  of dominant vegetation to enable the determination of various measures of
  cover (e.g. species, total vegetation). The method is not designed for species
  detection (Stohlgren <em>et al.</em> 1998; Vittoz and Guisan 2007; Nunes
  <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, the combination of the <em>Cover</em> module
  and the <em>Floristics</em> module ensure adequate sampling effort for plant
  species composition and cover (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).

<p>
  The <em>Cover</em> module involves the collection of quantitative, accurate
  and repeatable measures of vegetation and substrate cover within the plot,
  using the point-intercept method. Cover is defined as the percentage of
  vertical projection of the vegetation or substrate present within the plot
  (Bonham 2013). Vegetation cover is characterised by species, growth form and
  the height of lower, mid and upper vegetation strata, while substrate cover is
  characterised by substrate type (e.g. bare ground, litter, rocks or biological
  soil crusts; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Cover is interpreted from the number of ‘hits’ for each species, growth form
  and height, plus substrate type, at 1 m intervals along 10 x 100 m transects
  in a grid configuration (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), for a total of 1010 point-intercepts. The
  transect layout includes five transects 20 m apart orientated north (N) to
  south (S) and five transects 20 m apart orientated east (E) to west (W; <a href="#figure-1">Figure
  1</a>). Transect ends are at least initially located and recorded with a Trimble®
  R1 (see
  <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot selection and layout</a></em> module) to ensure positional accuracy and
  that transects can be relocated.
</p>
<p>
  A graduated staff is used to measure the height of vegetation at each
  point-intercept, enabling coarse height profiles to be created (Muir
  <em>et al.</em> 2011). A downward-pointing laser is mounted on the staff to
  mark each intercept. Canopy hits are determined at each point-intercept using
  a GRS Densitometer™ for sites with an overstorey (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). Use of a
  densitometer also allows for measures of ‘In Canopy Sky’ (ICS) as an overstory
  cover class, attributed to a species. This concept is taken from field
  techniques implemented for remote sensing field validation (Muir
  <em>et al.</em> 2011). ICS is recorded where the crosshairs of the
  densitometer mark a point within the bounds of a canopy but do not actually
  intercept any vegetation (<a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>). The inclusion of this class allows for
  vegetation cover measures including foliage projective cover and opaque canopy
  cover to be determined from the point-intercept data.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Cover</em> module includes a lite protocol in which cover is
  interpreted from the number of ‘hits’ for each species, growth form and
  height, plus substrate type, at 1 m intervals along 4 x 100 m transects in a
  grid configuration (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>), for a total of 404 point-intercepts. The
  transect layout includes two transects 40 m apart orientated north to south
  (N2/S2 and N4/S4) and two transects 40 m apart orientated east to west (E2/W2
  and E4/W4; <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>). As with the full protocol, transect ends are at least
  initially located and recorded with a Trimble® R1 (see
  <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot selection and layout</a></em>
  module) to ensure positional accuracy and that transects can be relocated.
</p>
<p>
  The full protocol which collects cover data from 1010 point-intercepts is best
  practice and recommended, particularly for studies that require reliable
  measures of cover per species. The lite protocol is intended for use where
  survey time is limited and may be suitable in studies where interpreting cover
  per growth form or fractional cover (the fraction of living vegetation [i.e.
  photosynthetic], dead vegetation [i.e. non-photosynthetic], and bare ground)
  is sufficient.
