    Cover recorded from 1010 point-intercepts across the plot for all intercepts from the ground to the canopy, including substrate, species, growth form and height.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<h4 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        This method works best when conducted with two surveyors, one using the
        staff and determining the point-intercept reading, and the other
        entering the data directly into the App.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        The guidelines below provide additional information for various
        point-intercept situations so that the surveyor can make the most
        appropriate judgement to ensure consistency.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Accuracy and speed of collecting point intercept data improves with
        experience. Laying out a set of tape measures along all the transects,
        or a set of transects (i.e. all the N–S transects, then all the E–W
        transects) rather than just one transect at a time, is more efficient.
        This is particularly the case if the survey team comprises more
        generalist surveyors and/or volunteers who can lay out the tapes while
        the vegetation specialist commences the point-intercept transects.
      </p>
    
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-the-laser-pointer">Using the laser pointer</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Using the laser pointer takes the guesswork out of what is (and what is
        not) a hit. If you cannot see the laser beam on the ground try one of
        the following tips:
      </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            You cannot see the laser because it is in the sun – rotate the staff
            so the laser is in a shadow.
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            The laser beam hits vegetation before it hits the substrate –
            temporarily move the vegetation out of the way.
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            The battery is flat – change the battery (always carry spare
            batteries and/or a spare laser).

<h4 id="rules-for-determining-what-is-a-hit">
  Rules for determining what is a ‘hit’
</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If a part of a plant is touching the staff between the laser pointer and
        the densitometer, and a plant of the same species
        <em>and</em> growth form is also being intercepted with the laser
        pointer, the uppermost intercept is recorded as a hit and all lower
        intercepts are ignored. This rule holds true for multiple intercepts of
        the same species <em>and</em> growth form.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If part of a tree or shrub intersects the vertical line of sight through
        the densitometer, this is recorded at a hit.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If you intercept a dead plant and can determine what the species is,
        this is recorded as hit for that species but flagged as ‘dead’.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If you intercept a dead plant but you cannot determine what the species
        is, this is recorded as an ‘annual forb’, ‘annual grass’ or ‘shrub/tree’
        (pre-recorded field names) and flagged as ‘dead’.
      </p>
    
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-the-grs-densitometer">Using the GRS Densitometer™</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Ensure the graduated staff is adjusted so that the densitometer is at
        eye-level.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Level both of the densitometer bubble-levels and then look through the
        instrument so that the sighting marks (cross hairs and circle) are
        aligned.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If working in bright sunlight, a piece of coloured cellophane can be
        placed over the top of the densitometer and secured with a rubber band
        to reduce glare.

<h4 id="estimating-tree-height">Estimating tree height</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Tree height should be estimated using a forestry rangefinder for rapid
        and accurate height measurements. The person entering the data into the
        App can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over their shoulder and
        record tree height when required.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        The <em>Nikon Forestry Pro II Rangefinder</em> is designed for measuring
        the height of trees. It can log up to 250 measurements taken with either
        actual distance, horizontal distance, height, angle and vertical
        separation (difference in height between two targets), and three-point
        measurement (height between two points). Distance measurements can be
        made using either First Target or Distant Target mode depending on
        whether the tree is in front of or behind other trees.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        When using a rangefinder, the distance and the angle to the top of the
        tree are measured at the same time, and then the distance angle to the
        base of the tree are measured at the same time. The internal calculator
        does the mathematics to calculate the height. Ensure you are far enough
        from the tree, at least the distance of the height of the tree, and can
        see the top and base of the tree.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be estimated using
        the following methods:
      </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            Clinometer and tape (Department of Environment and Climate Change
            2007)
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>Mobile phone applications.</p>
        
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        When using a clinometer, find a place to stand where you can see the top
        of the tree. Your distance from the tree should at least be equal to the
        height of the tree. Measure the distance to the tree and your eye height
        using a tape. Look through the clinometer with one eye and at the tree
        with the other eye. Line up the crosshair in the clinometer with the top
        of the tree. Read the value on the percent scale. This gives you the
        tree's height as a percentage of the distance from the tree (e.g. a
        reading of 50% means the height of the tree is half the distance you are
        from the tree). Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:
      </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            Tree height = clinometer reading / 100 x distance to tree + eye
            height
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            On sloping ground, two readings will need to be taken (treetop
            (reading 1) and tree base (reading 2)). When the tree base is below
            eye level, the two percent values are added. Calculate the height of
            the tree using the equation:
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 + clinometer reading 2) / 100 x
            distance to tree
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            When the tree base is above eye level, the tree base percent is
            subtracted from the treetop percent. Calculate the height of the
            tree using the following equation:
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 - clinometer reading 2) / 100 x
            distance to tree
          </p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          <p>
            See <a href="#appendix-d">Appendix D</a> for diagrams for using a clinometer in each
            situation.
          </p>
        
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        There are several mobile phone applications that provide an estimate of
        tree height by using the device’s sensors to measure the angles to the
        top and bottom of the tree. Like the clinometer guidelines above, a
        measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the
        height. Some apps allow the user to enter a measurement made with a
        tape, while others allow the user to enter and store the distance of
        their stride, and then enter the number of strides into the app to
        calculate the distance to the tree. Certain apps (e.g. Arboreal – Tree
        Height) make use of the device’s augmented reality technology to measure
        this distance, whereby the user moves close to the trunk of a tree
        (within 1 m), moves the device to locate the tree, aims at the tree and
        presses mark, holds the device upright while walking away from the tree
        to about the same length as the tree height, and presses mark again to
        calculate the distance.

        the laser pointer. If the laser beam is intercepted by vegetation, move
        the vegetation aside so that the laser beam reaches the substrate.

        For each point-intercept, assess and record the substrate from the
        categories available (drop-down list):

          <p>
            Crypto (cryptogam, i.e. any lichen, moss, algae, crust, etc. present
            on the soil surface).

            Litter (dried vegetation not attached and not identifiable; if
            litter is attached and identifiable as a plant, it should be
            recorded as this species but flagged as being dried).

            CWD (coarse woody debris detached from source and greater than 10 cm
            diameter at point of intercept; woody debris less than 10 cm at
            point of intercept should be recorded as ‘Litter’).

        Where the laser beam intersects with a vascular plant, the plant’s
        uppermost height at the point of intersection is recorded along with
        species name and growth form. Measurements can be rounded to the nearest
        centimetre from the markings on the staff. Continue recording all other
        plant species (and height) that are intersected by the beam to a height
        of 1.5 m (see <a href="#additional-guidelines">guidelines</a>).
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Record all plants (species and uppermost height) that the staff touches
        between the laser pointer (1.5 m) and the densitometer (eye level).

        The GRS Densitometer™ is used to view canopy intercepts that are taller
        than the densitometer. Look through the densitometer to determine
        whether any portion of a tree/shrub crown intersects the vertical line
        of sight through the densitometer. The vertical line of sight is
        obtained by leveling both of the densitometer bubble-levels and then
        looking through the instrument so that the sighting marks (cross hairs
        and circle) are aligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        If foliage or branches of a live shrub/tree are sighted in the cross
        hairs, record each species name and estimate the height at the uppermost
        intercept using a rangefinder or other height estimation method (see
        <a href="#additional-guidelines">guidelines</a>).
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        If no part of the foliage or branches are sighted in the cross hairs but
        the vertical line is still within the canopy boundary, record as ‘In
        Canopy Sky’ (ICS; see <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a> for further information).

        Repeat steps 6 to 13 at every 1 m interval along the transect. This will
        give a total of 101 point-intercepts for transect.
      </p>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    
      <p>
        Repeat steps 2 to 14 for each of the remaining point-intercept transect
        lines until all 10 have been completed. This will give 1010
        point-intercepts for the plot.

        At the completion of the point-intercept data collection, select ‘Finish
        Point-intercept’.
