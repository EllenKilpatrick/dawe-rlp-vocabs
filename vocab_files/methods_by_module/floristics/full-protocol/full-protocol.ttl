    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 id="searching-for-species">Searching for species</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that a single surveyor searches the plot (1 ha) for at
      least 60 minutes to record all the flora species present.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the vegetation is sparse and/or has low diversity (either naturally or
      due to disturbance), a search time of 30–45 minutes may be suitable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the vegetation is dense and/or has high diversity, a search time of at
      least 90 minutes is recommended.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In each scenario, if no new species is recorded for 15 minutes, you can
      finish searching earlier.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a point of searching all micro-habitats within the plot (e.g. rocky
      escarpments, low points with/near water, litter underneath shrubs and
      trees, further away from the disturbances).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Other surveyors can help by informing on any uncommon or inconspicuous
      species observed while setting up/completing other modules.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="species-identification">Species identification</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      When entering a field name for your vouchers it is essential that the
      field name makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for
      data collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the
      name is used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you
      must be consistent with its use over the project area! Your field names
      will not be made publicly available when the plot data is published,
      however herbarium staff will have access to your field names.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid using labels such as ‘<em>Acacia</em> sp.’, use a descriptive word
      instead of ‘sp.’ (e.g. ‘<em>Acacia</em> spiky’) this saves confusion later
      regarding whether it was a genuine species in a non-identifiable
      vegetative form or not.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use consistent taxonomy across the jurisdictions following published names
      used in the Australian Plant Name Index.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A photo should be taken for unknown species that have been assigned a
      field name to help identify them when surveying other plots or completing
      other modules (e.g. <em>Cover</em>, <em>Vegetation mapping</em>).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collecting-vouchers">Collecting vouchers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Permits are required to collect flora voucher specimens and they must be
      collected in accordance with the conditions and guidelines in each
      jurisdictional permit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collection of flora vouchers of rare, threatened or endangered species
      should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued
      existence of the population. Collection of threatened species may require
      additional information to be obtained to fulfil permitting conditions
      requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If collecting a voucher specimen would jeopardise the continued existence
      of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the following can
      serve as the required voucher (listed in decreasing order of preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Portion of fertile plant without the root.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Photos of plant in conjunction with piece of fertile plant or plant
          parts (leaves and flowers or fruits).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant specimen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sterile plant specimen only, or photos only.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Discretion should be used in the case of re-visited populations of rare,
      threatened or endangered flora during monitoring programs as it may not be
      necessary to document each observation with a specimen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when available:
      flowers or buds, leaves, fruit and bark (for trees). See <a href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a> for an
      example. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens needed to
      represent each species by maximising the number of plant components (e.g.
      flowers, fruit, leaves) on each sample collected.
    </p>

</p>
<p>

  fruit and bark.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If available, collect young, actively growing material for plant tissue
      vouchering. Although it is inevitable that during some surveys only
      sterile or vegetative material will be available, such material should
      still be collected. The quantity of leaf material collected needs to be
      sufficient to enable removal of samples for genetic profiling (equivalent
      to approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> or five eucalypt leaves). For small
      plants, this may require collection of at least two specimens – one to be
      vouchered and one for a plant tissue sample.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal material
      and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and Juncaceae.
      See <a href="#figure-9">Figure 9</a> for an example.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    
    <p>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in a small
      snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  plant collected, including the basal material and roots.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ideally specimens should be placed into the plant press before leaving
      each plot. However, as a minimum requirement, press specimens by the end
      of each day’s field work. Pressing plants in the field ensures that none
      are lost and also speeds up the identification process as diagnostic
      characters will be better preserved soon after collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When pressing, use one folded tabloid sized newspaper sheet for each
      specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently – to a maximum
      of one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently for bulky
      specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming mouldy.
      Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate more frequent
      changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight (either
      in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell walls
      enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be
      transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the plot which it
      was recorded from.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A photo may be useful to assist in the accurate identification of a
      species, particularly for species where colour is important to
      identification but may not be preserved in the dried specimen.

      Label each specimen securely with a unique voucher label provided by
      TERN/DAWE. Place the label on stems or away from any plant parts that will
      need to be examined for identification purposes (<a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>). Use paper
      envelopes for small specimens and attach the voucher label to the
      envelope.

      For each specimen, assign a field name. Where you are confident of the
      identification, the field name should be a definitive species name. Where
      the identification is unknown, it should be given a descriptive name (e.g.
      ‘yellow daisy flower’). The field name given during this step should be
      used as the field name for the point-intercept data collection every time
      that species is encountered (see the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a></em> module).

      Once scanned, the App will ask for a growth form and provide a drop-down
      list of growth forms to select from. If there is a second growth form of a
      species, select this from the ‘Growth Form #2’ drop-down list. Press the
      ‘<em>i</em>’ (information) button for a summary of each growth form
      (<a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>).

    <p>
      If required, take a photo/s of the specimen or an
      <em>in situ</em> individual by pressing the ‘Photo’ button. A photo
      reference scale should be used in each photo (see <a href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a>).

      If collecting plant tissue vouchers, press the ‘Collect plant tissue
      voucher’ button to navigate to the
      <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module. Once the associated plant tissue
      voucher barcode label is scanned into the App, return to the
      <em>Floristics</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Press the ‘Save’ button to save the species record and begin recording the
      next species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once all species have been recorded and their voucher barcode scanned,
      press the ‘Complete Module’ button to return to the ‘Module Selection’
      screen.

      After labeling and scanning each specimen, place larger specimens directly
      into a plastic bag, and smaller specimens into paper bags, then the
      plastic bag, ready for transferring to a plant press.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the voucher specimen of each flora species in a plant press in the
      field (<a href="#figure-7">Figure 7</a>), preferably before leaving each plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the time of pressing, refer to the
      <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module for procedures and guidelines to
      collect leaf material from each voucher.
