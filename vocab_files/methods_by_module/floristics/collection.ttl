    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two protocols for
  recording flora species composition within the plot:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/35175f0d-bdd7-4e32-908f-17f7239e78fa">Full protocol</a> – voucher specimens collected for all species present in
      each plot for identification by the relevant herbarium.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/bc2ba93e-43f9-425f-83cd-bbf5c422bdf8">Lite protocol</a> – voucher specimens collected for a subset of the species
      present in each plot vouchered for identification by the relevant
      herbarium, the subset being new (i.e. not vouchered from the project area,
      including previous monitoring periods), unknown, important (e.g. data
      deficient, range extension, uncharacteristic growth form), contentious
      (i.e. disputed or uncertain taxonomy) and threatened species (unless
      collection is not permitted or will jeopardise the population). Field
      botanist identification and photo vouchers collected for the remaining
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The full protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for collecting
  vouchers of all flora species from the plot, attaching voucher labels,
  entering vouchers into the App by scanning the barcode, allocating the species
  growth form and field name, pressing the vouchers, and maintaining the pressed
  vouchers both during and after the field survey. The guidelines provide
  further information on pressing techniques, including specifics for dealing
  with small species, succulent species and wet specimens, and taxonomic
  preferences.
</p>
<p>
  The lite protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for collecting
  vouchers of the subset of the flora species from the plot, attaching voucher
  labels, entering vouchers into the App by scanning the barcode or entering
  species into the App if they have already been vouchered from the project
  area, allocating the species growth form and taking photo vouchers (in-ground
  habit and close-ups of key distinguishing features). The guidelines provide
  further information on identifying species using keys, flora reference guides
  and local herbarium collections, and photography techniques, including
  specifics for photographing key distinguishing features to assist in
  identification.
</p>
<p>
  Plant species identifications/assigned field names (linked to barcodes) act as
  the primary key for subsequent data collection for that species within a
  visit, thereby ensuring consistent nomenclature. Voucher specimens are
  intended to be identified by herbarium botanists and a subset of specimens
  will be included in the respective local herbaria, subject to the standards
  prescribed by each institution.
</p>
<p>
  Tracking of voucher specimens is of vital importance. Consequently, TERN/DAWE
  have created printed adhesive voucher labels that have a barcode on them that
  can be scanned by mobile device software and linked directly into the App. The
  voucher labels are available from TERN/DAWE. Note that a separate batch of
  sequential barcodes are used for each flora voucher, as well as each plant
  tissue sample, fauna voucher, soil sample and soil metagenomic sample
  collected. Therefore, care is needed to ensure the correct label is being
  used.
</p>
<p>The <em>Floristics</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

          >Plot selection and layout</a
        ></em
      >
      – the plot must be established first, and the boundaries defined to ensure
      the surveyor remains within the plot boundaries while searching for flora
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em

          >Plant tissue vouchering</a
        ></em
      >
      – a plant tissue sample is required from each flora species vouchered, or
      a subset. Additional material is collected with the herbarium voucher
      specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em
        ><a

          >Cover</a
        ></em
      >
      – all flora species identifications/assigned field names need to be
      recorded in the App to ensure consistent naming if they are encountered at
      the point-intercepts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>

          >Plot description</a
        ></em
      >
      – the dominant flora species within each structural layer need to recorded
      with consistent naming. This is particularly important if any of the
      dominant species are unknown and need to be assigned a field name.
    </p>

<p>
  Flora species composition is an integral component of ecological assessments
  as it provides a direct measure of the flora species diversity present in a
  given area at a given time. It is also a measurement required for the study,
  reporting and management of biodiversity change, making it an essential
  variable for any ecological monitoring program (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2013).
  Flora species composition is a major factor in the analysis of plot data
  (Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007). It can be used to inform on survey
  conditions (e.g. presence or absence of annual and ephemeral species,
  flowering phenology, germination, species condition), and allows for the
  spatial and temporal analysis of the presence-absence of flora species within
  and among plots (Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018). This includes species of
  conservation significance and significant weeds, and this information is
  particularly informative for development assessments aiming to avoid impacts
  to, and conservation programs aiming to improve habitat for species of
  conservation significance or important populations (Monks
  <em>et al.</em> 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Flora species composition can provide information about a range of different
  factors, making it both fundamental and of high importance to assessing
  vegetation conditions. The presence and persistence of a flora species or a
  group of species reflects the presence or recent presence of conditions that
  favour such species (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009). Flora species composition
  is also linked to parameters such as soil type (van der Ent
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), soil properties (e.g. electrical conductivity, pH,
  nutrients; Gibson <em>et al.</em> 2004; Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2004).,
  ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling; Ehrenfeld 2003), microclimate
  (e.g. soil temperature; Smith and Johnson 2004), plant-plant interactions
  (e.g. competition; Belsky 1992), and fauna-flora interactions (e.g. grazing,
  pollination; Andrew and Lange 1986; Scaccabarozzi <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Flora voucher specimens are routinely collected to support floristic data
  collected during ecological surveys (e.g. Biological Survey of South
  Australia; Heard and Channon 1997) and research projects (e.g. genetic
  analysis of a taxon; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2020). They are crucial to
  authenticate the taxonomy of a species (Culley 2013). Field identifications
  are prone to error (Scott and Hallam 2003; Lacerda and Nimmo 2010), and
  collecting vouchers to be expertly identified by herbarium botanists ensures
  that flora species composition is measured correctly and consistently (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). Flora vouchers are also a tool for identifying
  localities of a taxon (Feeley 2012) and undertaking taxonomic revisions. Flora
  species classification is constantly changing and shifts in species alignments
  and groupings are made as new evidence comes to light (Craven
  <em>et al.</em> 2004; Maslin and Reid 2012). Identifications are subject to
  change and voucher specimens help cross-reference these changes to previous
  research.
</p>
<p>
  Flora vouchers are widely used for purposes other than taxonomy, including in
  genetic, ecological and environmental studies (Culley 2013). Vouchers allow
  for genetic comparisons to examine spatial and temporal genetic variation and
  processes such as genetic bottlenecks (Cozzolino <em>et al.</em> 2007;
  Dormontt <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are useful in studies of the impacts of
  climate change on flora, including to track shifts in species distributions,
  flowering times and stomatal density (Woodward 1987; Feeley 2012; Calinger
  <em>et al.</em>
  2013), and can be used to identify conservation priorities (MacDougall
  <em>et al.</em> 1998). Opportunities also exist to advance DNA barcoding of
  plants by building DNA barcode databases using flora vouchers (Dormontt
  <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The use of photographs to complement herbarium voucher specimens is not a new
  concept (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017; Gómez-Bellver <em>et al.</em> 2019).
  Usually such photographs provide a record of details that cannot be preserved
  in dried specimens that are critical for species identification (e.g. flower
  shape and/or colour; LaFrankie Jr and Chua 2015), or illustrate the habitat
  where the specimens were collected (Gómez-Bellver <em>et al.</em> 2019). There
  are several advantages of photo vouchers, including the preservation of the
  colour and shape of features, all features can be recorded, they are
  long-lasting and can be readily duplicated without limit, storage and curation
  is straightforward and affordable, and damage to plants is minimised
  (LaFrankie Jr and Chua 2015).

<p>
  Floristics is the study of the flora species present within a specific
  geographical area. In the <em>Floristics</em> module, all vascular flora
  species (native and introduced) within the plot are identified (to the species
  level wherever possible and the subspecies level if relevant). Flora species
  composition is recorded in the form of a species list or inventory (Hnatiuk
  <em>et al.</em> 2009), and this forms the basis of the fundamental collection
  of growth form (e.g. forb, grass, shrub, tree) and cover of all flora species
  within the plot (NERP National Condition Working Group 2015). Flora species
  composition is also an essential component of vegetation classification and
  mapping (see the <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module; Hnatiuk
  <em>et al.</em> 2009).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Floristics</em> module involves the collection of voucher specimens of
  all species to support the species list recorded. Flora vouchers ensure
  correct species identification, provide a taxonomic reference and ensure the
  repeatability of studies. Specimens of known and unknown species are collected
  and preserved appropriately in the field using a plant press, and later
  identified by taxonomic experts from the relevant herbarium (Heard and Channon
  1997; Culley 2013; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  A flora voucher consists of a pressed and dried specimen of an individual,
  containing aboveground structures (leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, seeds) and
  belowground structures (roots, rhizomes) when possible. The specimen is
  usually mounted onto acid-free paper, although depending on the type of
  specimen, it may be stored in a box, packet or jar under controlled
  environmental conditions (Culley 2013).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Floristics</em> module includes two protocols: (1) a full protocol in
  which voucher specimens are collected for all species present in each plot;
  and (2) a lite protocol in which voucher specimens are collected for a subset
  of the species present in each plot, with photo vouchers collected for the
  remaining species. At least one voucher specimen is collected for each species
  present in the project area. The full protocol is best practice and
  recommended, particularly for baseline surveys and inexperienced surveyors, as
  all vouchers are provided to the relevant herbarium for identification by
  taxonomic experts. The full protocol is highly recommended for at least the
  first time a project area is monitored, and for more arid environments, the
  first time a project area is monitored after favorable environmental
  conditions.
</p>
<p>
  The lite protocol may be suitable for use by experienced field botanists that
  are able to confidently identify the majority of flora species in their
  region, or during repeat surveys in monitoring plots where voucher specimens
  have been previously collected. This is intended to reduce survey time for
  experienced field botanists or for repeat surveys in monitoring plots, while
  ensuring there is a reference to verify any disputed field identifications.
  When implementing the lite protocol, after a voucher specimen is collected at
  the first instance of each species within the project area, the majority of
  the following instances can be photo vouchered without a physical voucher. The
  subset of species requiring a physical voucher from each plot includes new
  (i.e. not vouchered from the project area, including previous monitoring
  periods), unknown, important (e.g. data deficient, range extension,
  uncharacteristic growth form), contentious (i.e. disputed or uncertain
  taxonomy) and threatened species (unless collection is not permitted or will
  jeopardise the population). As with the full protocol, physical vouchers are
  still provided to the relevant herbarium for identification by taxonomic
  experts, but the lite protocol alternatively allows identifications to be
  completed by experienced field botanists (i.e. based on confirmed vouchers
  from previous monitoring periods, or readily identifiable species when
  identification is certain). If any of the field identifications are disputed,
  there is at least one voucher specimen and photo vouchers for verification. If
  negotiated, taxonomic experts from herbaria may offer identification from the
  photos, or other expert opinions may be sought.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Floristics</em> module is best undertaken during the main period of
  plant emergence and reproduction (i.e. spring), which may vary based on survey
  scope and location, as well as season. Although it is possible to survey flora
  outside of this period, it is likely that the total number of species will be
  underestimated. Considerable effort is required to locate signs of seasonal
  species, and even this is unlikely to compensate for the effect of sub-optimal
  survey timing (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009). For additional details on optimal
  survey timing across Australia see the
  <em>Introduction and planning</em> chapter.
