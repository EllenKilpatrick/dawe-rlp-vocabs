    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 id="searching-for-species-1">Searching for species</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that a single surveyor searches the plot (1 ha) for at
      least 60 minutes to record all the flora species present.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the vegetation is sparse and/or has low diversity (either naturally of
      due to disturbance), a search time of 30–45 minutes may be suitable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the vegetation is dense and/or has high diversity, a search time of at
      least 90 minutes is recommended.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In each scenario, if no new species is recorded for 15 minutes, you can
      finish searching earlier.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a point of searching all micro-habitats within the plot (e.g. rocky
      escarpments, low points with/near water, litter underneath shrubs and
      trees, further away from the disturbances).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Other surveyors can help by informing on any uncommon or inconspicuous
      species observed while setting up/completing other modules.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="species-identification-1">Species identification</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flora species should be identified in the field using taxonomic keys and
      flora reference guides (published in books, journals and apps;
      Environmental Protection Authority 2016). If a species cannot be
      identified with absolute confidence it should be vouchered.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When entering a field name for your vouchers it is essential that the
      field name makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for
      data collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the
      name is used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you
      must be consistent with its use over the study area! Your field names will
      not be made publicly available when the plot data is published, however
      herbarium staff will have access to your field names.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use consistent taxonomy across the jurisdictions following published names
      used in the Australian Plant Name Index.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="taking-photographs">Taking photographs</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try to ensure you photograph a plant that has good vigour and
      representative of the species within the plot (i.e. try to avoid
      photographing plants that are not typical for the species).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a photo that shows the overall growth form of the plant (see <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>), as the distinctions in growth form may not be apparent to the
      surveyor, but crucial to identification.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a photo of as many plant features that are available (e.g. leaves,
      flowers, fruits, buds, bark; see <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don’t forget about the below-ground parts of the plant. Although, it may
      not be feasible to dig up a tree to take pictures of its roots (see
      <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>), many smaller plants have distinctive characteristics or
      structures attached to their roots, rhizomes, or storage organs (tubers,
      bulbs, corms) that can be used to accurately identify them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photos need to be in focus, not too light or too dark, and the colour
      should accurately reflect what you are seeing with your eye when you take
      the picture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A suitable photographic reference scale should be used depending on the
      species/feature being photographed. For example, a range pole should be
      placed against the trunk of a tree being photographed, and a bank card
      sized scale should be used in a photo of feature such as a flower or fruit
      (see <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>). If you do not have an actual reference scale, use
      something you have on hand to provide a reference (e.g. pen, pencil,
      compass).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The staff used to mount the densitometer (see the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a></em> module)
      can double as a range pole for photographs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A spare camera should be taken on field surveys as a backup in case of any
      storage or camera issues with your mobile device. The App allows for the
      input of a photo number in each of the photo collection fields.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collecting-vouchers-1">Collecting vouchers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Important species that should be vouchered include (Environmental
      Protection Authority 2016):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Specimens of new populations of rare, threatened or endangered flora.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Specimens of key species in new occurrences of TECs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Specimens that appear to represent new species or that have atypical
          characteristics.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Specimens of bioregional range extensions, including introduced (weed)
          species.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Permits are required to collect flora voucher specimens and they must be
      collected in accordance with the conditions and guidelines in each
      jurisdictional permit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collection of flora vouchers of rare, threatened or endangered species
      should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued
      existence of the population. Collection of threatened species may require
      additional information to be obtained to fulfil permitting conditions
      requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If collecting a voucher specimen may be detrimental to the reproductive
      success of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the
      following can serve as the required voucher (listed in decreasing order of
      preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Portion of fertile plant without the root.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Photographs of plant in conjunction with piece of fertile plant or
          plant parts (leaves and flowers or fruits).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Photographs of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant
          specimen.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sterile plant specimen only, or photographs only.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Discretion should be used in the case of re-visited populations of rare,
      threatened or endangered flora during monitoring programs as it may not be
      necessary to document each observation with a specimen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when available:
      flowers or buds, leaf, fruit, and bark (for trees). See <a href='#figure-8'>Figure 8</a> for an
      example. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens needed to
      represent each species by maximising the number of plant components (e.g.
      flowers, fruit, leaves) on each sample collected.
    </p>

    fruit and bark.
  </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      If available, collect young, actively growing material for plant tissue
      vouchering. Although it is inevitable that during some surveys only
      sterile or vegetative material will be available, such material should
      still be collected. The quantity of leaf material collected needs to be
      sufficient to enable removal of samples for genetic profiling (equivalent
      to approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> or five eucalypt leaves). For small
      plants this may require collection of at least two specimens – one to be
      vouchered and one for a plant tissue sample.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal material
      and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and Juncaceae.
      See <a href='#figure-9'>Figure 9</a> for an example.
    </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Figure 9. Labelled voucher specimen of small grass species with the whole
    plant collected, including the basal material and roots.
  </p>
  <li>
    <p>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in a small
      snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ideally specimens should be placed into the plant press before leaving
      each plot. However, as a minimum requirement, press specimens by the end
      of each day’s field work. Pressing plants in the field ensures that none
      are lost and also speeds up the identification process as diagnostic
      characters will be better preserved soon after collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When pressing, use one folded tabloid sized newspaper sheet for each
      specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently – to a maximum
      of one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently for bulky
      specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming mouldy.
      Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when collected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate more frequent
      changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight (either
      in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell walls
      enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be
      transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the site which it
      was recorded from.

      Search the plot for each plant species within the plot (<a href='#figure-3'>Figure 3</a>). Your
      search (1 surveyor) should last between 30 and 90 minutes or more
      depending on the diversity and density of the vegetation (see <a href="#additional-guidelines">Additional
      guidelines</a> below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collect specimens for new (i.e. not vouchered from the project area,
      including previous monitoring periods), unknown, important (e.g. data
      deficient, range extension, uncharacteristic growth form), contentious
      (i.e. disputed or uncertain taxonomy) and threatened species (unless
      collection is not permitted or will jeopardise the population) present
      within the plot (<a href='#figure-3'>Figure 3</a>), taking enough material to cover an A3 size
      herbarium sheet (Note: prior to collection a permit may be required – see
      the Introduction and planning chapter).

  </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      While searching the plot, select the ‘Floristics’ module and then ‘Lite
      protocol’ in the App (<a href='#figure-10'>Figure 10</a>) to record flora species not required to
      be vouchered.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assign a field name for each flora species not required to be vouchered
      (i.e. known, unimportant and least concern species with a voucher specimen
      already collected from the project area). The field name should be a
      previously recorded definitive species name or descriptive name (e.g.
      ‘yellow daisy flower’). The field name given during this step should be
      used as the field name for the point-intercept data collection every time
      that species is encountered (see the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a> module).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The App will automatically assign the growth form previously allocated to
      the species, but also provides a drop-down list of growth forms to select
      from if you need to edit the growth form. If there is a second growth form
      of a species, select this from the ‘Growth Form #2’ drop-down list. Press
      the help button for a summary of each growth form. Press the ‘i’
      (information) button for a summary of each growth form (<a href='#appendix-a'>Appendix A</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The App will ask for photos to be taken using your mobile device of the
      growth form (i.e. entire plant) and key distinguishing features if present
      (e.g. leaves, fruits, flowers). A photo reference scale should be used in
      each photo (see <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>). Example photo vouchers are provided in
      <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>. Press the help buttons for instructions and guidelines for
      taking photos of the growth form and various features (see also <a href='#appendix-c'>Appendix C</a>).

    <p>
      For each specimen collected, assign a field name. Where you are confident
      of the identification, the field name should be a definitive species name.
      Where the identification is unknown, it should be given a descriptive name
      (e.g. ‘yellow daisy flower’). The field name given during this step should
      be used as the field name for the point-intercept data collection every
      time that species is encountered (see the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a></em> module).

      Once scanned, the App will ask for a growth form and provide a drop-down
      list of growth forms to select from. If there is a second growth form of a
      species, select this from the ‘Growth Form #2’ drop-down list. Press the
      ‘<em>i</em>’ (information) button for a summary of each growth form
      (<a href='#appendix-a'>Appendix A</a>).

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required, take a photo/s of the specimen or an
      <em>in-situ</em> individual by pressing the ‘Photo’ button. A photo
      reference scale should be used in each photo (see <a href='#appendix-b'>Appendix B</a>).

      If collecting plant tissue vouchers, press the ‘Collect plant tissue
      voucher’ button to navigate to the
      <em>Plant tissue vouchering</em> module. Once the associated plant tissue
      voucher barcode label is scanned into the App, return to the
      <em>Floristics</em> module.

  <li>
    <p>
      Press the ‘Save’ button to save the species record and begin recording the
      next species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once all species have been recorded and the voucher barcodes of vouchered
      species scanned, press the ‘Complete Module’ button to return to the
      ‘Module Selection’ screen.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After labelling and scanning each specimen, place larger specimens
      directly into a plastic bag, and smaller specimens into paper bags, then
      the plastic bag, ready for transferring to a plant press.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the voucher specimen of each plant species in a plant press in the
