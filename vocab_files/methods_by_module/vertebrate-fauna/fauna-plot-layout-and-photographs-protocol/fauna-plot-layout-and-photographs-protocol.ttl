  Pre-survey – stratification and prospective plot locations

    <p>
      Follow the protocols set out in the Plot selection and layout module ,
      Pre-survey – stratification and prospective plot locations .
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine the location of the vegetation and soils plots already
      established and identify potential locations where the fauna plot can be
      positioned.

  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">On-ground site positioning</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Assess the vegetation and habitat surrounding the vegetation and soils
      plot to determine the most appropriate area to co-locate the fauna plot.
      Avoid disturbance areas, especially vehicle tracks. Ensure the vegetation
      community, terrain and habitat, are homogenous with the vegetation and
      soils plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if the area enables a boundary of the fauna plot to be shared
      with the vegetation and soils Plot in its entirety, or if it will need to
      be off-set.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Using the Trimble R1 GNSS to lay out the fauna plot</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once final plot locations have been determined in the field, switch on the
      Trimble R1 by depressing power button in center. It will flash green and
      blue as it looks to connect to Bluetooth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to the mobile device’s Bluetooth settings and turn Bluetooth ON.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the Devices list and wait for the “GNSS:XXX” to appear. Select it
      and you should be connected. Navigate to the GNSS Status App and select
      Source . If the GNSS is in recent pick list, then select. If not,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      select Position Source to be the Bluetooth and select from available
      devices.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Allow some time to let the accuracy drop to sub meter.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Open to the Plot selection and layout module in the App and navigate to
      the Plot layout screen. Register the new fauna plot by giving it a name.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To capture information about plot type, use the tick boxes to select if
      the plot is Impact or Control (no
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>boxes need to be ticked if these categories do not apply).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the Replicate # box, add in a number to define plot replication number
      (if the plot is the first or only of it’s type within a sampling unit,
      then the number will be 1).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Yes or No from the drop-down menu to define whether the plot will
      be permanently marked. If
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Yes , select where the iron droppers will be placed (NW, NE, SW or SE
      corners, center).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the plot is permanently labelled with the plot name, record where the
      plot is labelled (which iron dropper).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Add in the plot dimensions (in meters). As a standard, plots are 100 m by
      100 m (1 ha).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Decide on the SW corner of the plot, stand at that point and select Create
      Plot. The app will generate a grid of yellow point markers based on the
      plot dimensions added above. Your location is the blue dot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As a standard, the plot aligns in a north-south direction with the grid.
      If necessary, plot orientation can be altered using the orientation field
      (the app will automatically re-align the plot based on the degrees value
      added).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review the plot layout (repeat steps 11-12 if you want to shift plot
      location or alter dimensions or alignment).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To finalize the plot location, select Mark Closest Point . The point will
      be saved and turn green. Repeat this step until you have walked around the
      plot and all yellow points have changed to green.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Continue around the grid, remembering to include the Centre point. All 25
      points will save automatically. The start and end of each drift
      fence/pitfall line and center of each plot should be permanently marked
      using star droppers. In cases where this is not possible (some Indigenous
      lands, private or leasehold lands, rocky outcrops, etc.) at least one
      corner should be marked at minimum, especially if plots are to be
      revisited. Make sure to note where any permanent droppers have been placed
      by ticking the relevant check boxes (as detailed above).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plots may be marked with an aluminum tag to identify the plot name. This
      allows plots to be relocated easily and assists with ongoing monitoring
      and return surveys. Record the location (star dropper) with the aluminum
      tag in the label drop-down field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Finish Plot to move onto the other required plot-based modules, or
      if required select Drift fence/pitfall lines or trap lines to bring up
      guide lines (transect lines can be used to align tape measures or to put
      in wooden stakes/markers at the start and end of each drift fence/pitfall
      line, and each trap line).
