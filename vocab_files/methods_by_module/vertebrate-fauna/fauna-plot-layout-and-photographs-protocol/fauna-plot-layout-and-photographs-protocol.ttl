      Assess the vegetation and habitat surrounding the vegetation and soils

      Avoid disturbance areas, especially vehicle tracks. Ensure the vegetation
      community, terrain and habitat, are homogenous with the vegetation and
      soils plot.

  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if the area enables a boundary of the fauna plot to be shared

</h4>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Once final plot locations has been determined in the field, switch on the
      Trimble R1 by depressing the power button in the centre. It will flash
      green and blue as it looks to connect to Bluetooth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to the mobile device’s Bluetooth settings and turn Bluetooth ON.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the <em>Devices</em> list and wait for the “GNSS:XXX” to appear.
      Select it and you should be connected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to the GNSS Status App and select <em>Source</em>. If the GNSS is
      in recent pick list, then select. If not, select
      <em>Position Source</em> to be the Bluetooth and select from available
      devices.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Allow some time to let the accuracy drop to sub metre.</p></li>

      <em>the App</em> and navigate to the <em>Plot layout</em> screen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Register the new fauna plot by giving it a name.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To capture information about plot type, use the tick boxes to select if
      the plot is <em>Impact</em> or <em>Control</em> (no boxes need to be
      ticked if these categories do not apply).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the <em>Replicate #</em> box, add in a number to define plot
      replication number (if the plot is the first or only of it’s type within a
      sampling unit, then the number will be 1).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> from the drop-down menu to define
      whether the plot will be permanently marked. If <em>Yes</em>, select where
      the iron droppers will be placed (NW, NE, SW or SE corners, centre).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the plot is permanently labelled with the plot name, record where the
      plot is labelled (which iron dropper).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Add in the plot dimensions (in metres). As a standard, plots are 100 m by
      100 m (1 ha).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Decide on the SW corner of the plot, stand at that point and select
      <em>Create Plot.</em> The app will generate a grid of yellow point markers
      based on the plot dimensions added above. Your location is the blue dot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As a standard, the plot aligns in a north-south direction with the grid.
      If necessary, plot orientation can be altered using the orientation field
      (the app will automatically re-align the plot based on the degrees value
      added).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review the plot layout (repeat steps 11-12 if you want to shift plot
      location or alter dimensions or alignment).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To finalise the plot location, select <em>Mark Closest Point</em>. The
      point will be saved and turn green. Repeat this step until you have walked
      around the plot and all yellow points have changed to green.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Continue around the grid, remembering to include the Centre point. All 25
      points will save automatically.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The start and end of each drift fence/pitfall line and centre of each plot
      should be permanently marked using star droppers. In cases where this is
      not possible (some Indigenous lands, private or leasehold lands, rocky
      outcrops, etc.) at least one corner should be marked at minimum,
      especially if plots are to be revisited. Make sure to note where any
      permanent droppers have been placed by ticking the relevant check boxes
      (as detailed above).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plots may be marked with an aluminium tag to identify the plot name. This
      allows plots to be relocated easily and assists with ongoing monitoring
      and return surveys. Record the location (star dropper) with the aluminium
      tag in the label drop-down field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select <em>Finish Plot</em> to move onto the other required plot-based
      modules, or if required select
      <em>Drift fence/pitfall lines or trap lines</em> to bring up guide lines
      (transect lines can be used to align tape measures or to put in wooden
      stakes/markers at the start and end of each drift fence/pitfall line, and
      each trap line).
