    <p>
      Arrive at the Fauna Plot to be surveyed, ideally between mid-morning
      (i.e., after all traps have been checked) and mid-afternoon, avoiding cold
      and hot temperatures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Familiarize with the Fauna Plot boundaries.</p></li>
  <li><p>Open the app, and select ‘Vertebrate fauna, ‘Diurnal search’.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select ‘survey details’. Select the applicable ‘plot name’ or type it if
      it is not listed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the number of ‘observers’, the default will be 1, tap and enter if
      different.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the weather conditions (these can be reviewed at the conclusion of
      the survey if you feel conditions changed from that noted at the start).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The app will populate todays date (tap to edit). Select ‘start survey’,
      and a timer will show at the top of the screen. The screen will show a map
      of the plot, indicating your position. Keep an eye on this screen to make
      sure you remain within the fauna plot boundary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Work across the Fauna Plot (wandering is acceptable) looking for fauna, or
      indirect signs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If suitable habitat is present within the fauna plot, rake leaf litter and
      the top 2-3 cm of topsoil, carefully searching for animals, particularly
      legless lizards. Rake back any moved leaf litter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move to the edge of the Fauna Plot (in any direction, if the habitat is
      homogenous with the plot), and actively search for fauna by lifting rocks,
      removing bark from trees, and lifting logs and fallen timber. Return rocks
      and logs back to their original position.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At the completion of the survey time (60 minutes if 1 surveyor, 30 minutes
      if 2 surveyors), select ‘end active search’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify, mark and release any animals that were hand caught (follow the
      procedures and guidelines in Section: Identify, measure and release
      protocols and take a tissue specimen following the procedures and
      guidelines in Section: Whole animal and tissue vouchering protocols . If
      the species has not been caught previously during the survey, follow the
      decision key shown Figure to determine if the animal should be vouchered.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Record direct or indirect observations</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      For each fauna observation, either a direct observation, or indirect sign
      of fauna, including tracks, scats, diggings, bones, feathers etc.,
      identifiable to the species level, select the ‘+’ symbol to add a new
      observation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A new screen will appear. Select Species name using the ‘look up’. As you
      type, options will be provided by class, order, family, genus, species.
      Enter to the level you are confident of the identification (e.g. enter to
      genus level if uncertain of the species). Where an identification is
      uncertain, only record the observation if a voucher specimen, photo or
      other evidence is taken for later identification. If the identification is
      only known to genus, manually assign a descriptive field species name e.g.
      Macropus ‘red legs’. Invertebrates and non-vascular flora are often only
      known to class or morphological group.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the identification is uncertain (i.e. pending the review of evidence
      collected), switch Confident toggle to ‘off’ (default is ‘on’ to indicate
      the surveyor is confident). If confident at the level of entry at Step 5
      (e.g. entered to genus level because uncertain of the species and there is
      no supporting evidence to refine the identification), then Confident
      toggle should be ‘on’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Source of identification from the drop-down list. If Confident
      toggle is ‘on’ the default selection is ‘field identification by
      observer’. If Confident toggle is ‘off’ the default selection becomes
      ‘awaiting identification’ and the record will be flagged for follow up
      through the curation process. For example, if evidence (e.g. photo, audio
      recording) is provided to support the record, which is later identified by
      an expert, the Source of identification is then updated to ‘identification
      of evidence by expert’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The date and time of the observation will be automatically recorded. Click
      to override the record date and time (i.e. if entering a record after the
      event).

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Number of individuals observed (zero, blank and no selection
      are invalid). Select if the count is exact or an estimate.

  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Observation method from the drop-down list (e.g., observed,
      heard, sign – track, sign – scat).

    <p>
      Click the camera button, to open the device camera and take photographs,
      ensuring a scale card is also in the photo. There is no need to collect
      samples.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record Habitat description using the drop-down lists or manual entry
      (e.g., structural formation, vegetation association, macro and
      microhabitat) (optional).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Record any additional Observation notes (optional).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record additional Observation details . Relevant fields will be visible
      based on the selection of class. Select the behavior, age, sex and
      reproductive status from the drop-down list and record morphological
      measurements (optional, as per Section : Identify, measure and release
      protocols).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a Voucher specimen is collected, switch toggle to ‘on’. Assign a unique
      barcode voucher label to the specimen and scan barcode ( Section : Whole
      animal and tissue vouchering protocols ). Select Voucher type from the
      drop-down list. For fauna remains, select the Condition of the specimen
      from the drop- down list. If a separate voucher reference number is
      assigned by the relevant museum, then this should be recorded in the
      Voucher comments field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If more than one voucher specimen is collected for the same observation
      (e.g., hair sample and a liver sample) then select toggle ‘on’ for
      Additional voucher specimen and repeat Step 17. Each specimen is allocated
      a unique QR code.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Save and Add if you wish to record an additional entry for the same
      location, date and time (e.g., if multiple bird species were observed
      flying over at the same time).

      Work across the Fauna Plot (wandering is acceptable) looking for fauna, or
      indirect signs. Note, unlike the diurnal search the nocturnal passive
      search should minimize survey timedisturbance, and raking of leaf litter,
      removal of tree bark, and lifting of rocks should not be undertaken.
      Instead, focus on looking for animal movement, rustling of vegetation, to
      detect animal presence.

  <li><p>Record observations as per above.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">Diurnal active search</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor
      time. Increased effort is recommended for non-trapping Fauna Plots. The
      effort can be increased by repeating the search on different days and time
      periods (i.e., morning and afternoon sessions under different weather and
      cloud cover conditions).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching may be conducted whilst the Fauna Plot is being
      trapped (i.e., you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods, i.e., ripping bark of trees, lifting logs etc., must
      be restricted to the outer edge of the Fauna Plot to limit disturbance.
      All rocks and timber, especially hollow logs, must be put back into place.
      Do not remove fauna refuges or move them so they no longer provide refuge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods can be conducted off-plot, within 20 m of the plot
      boundary, and not within an adjacent Vegetation and Soils plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimize noise when actively searching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If ground surfaces are sandy, the surveyors should ensure time is spent
      investigating these areas to identify tracks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching can be conducted at any time during daylight
      hours. If sandy surfaces are present, mid-mornings are recommended (after
      trap checking is completed as a priority), before tracks blow away.
      However, avoid cold weather conditions as animal movements will be
      limited, thus chance of observation will be low.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, for scat records, note the approximate age of the scat in
      the comments section - noting if it is considered fresh or old).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For track observations, note the approximate age of the track in the
      comments section, noting the track is considered fresh (i.e. overnight),
      or old – such as tracks left in heavy or previously wet soils.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record burrows, to species level where possible, based on the shape, and
      scats that may be present (use appropriate field guides such as Triggs
      (2004) and Moseby et al. (2012).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember to look up trees and amongst shrubs for bird nests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Nocturnal passive searching</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal passive search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor
      time. Increased effort is recommended for non-trapping Fauna Plots. The
      effort can be increased by repeating the search on different nights
      (rather than extended the search time for one session).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, schedule the nocturnal searches to avoid nights
      surrounding a full moon (all surveys should avoid a full moon where
      possible) if cloud cover is sparse.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal passive searching may be conducted whilst the Fauna Plot is
      being trapped (i.e. you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping). Ideally the search should commence between 1 and 2 hours after
      dark. Surveyors should take care to minimise noise and disturbance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Due to WHS concerns, nocturnal passive searches should not be conducted
      alone.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional techniques</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">Call play-back for birds and frogs</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back to encourage bird and frogs to respond, can be conducted,
      but is recommended as a separate activity, not included as part of the
      diurnal active searches, nocturnal passive searches, or bird surveys.
      Species recorded should be noted on the opportunistic observation module
      of the app, and the method noted as being ‘heard in response to call
      play-back’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back should not be undertaken within 30 minutes prior to a
      nocturnal passive search, as this may interfere with the results, i.e.
      some species have a delayed response to the calls being played.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back may be undertaken after the nocturnal passive search has
      concluded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As call play-back is not a specific method of the Vertebrate Fauna Module,
      the effort spent playing calls is not specified, however bear in mind the
      potential impact to trapping results (if the Fauna Plot is being trapped).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult field guides to determine which nocturnal bird species may be
      present in your area and habitat.
