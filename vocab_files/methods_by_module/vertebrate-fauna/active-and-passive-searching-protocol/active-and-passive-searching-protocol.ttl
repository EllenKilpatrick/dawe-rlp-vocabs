<h4 id="diurnal-active-search-1">A. Diurnal active search</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor
      time. Increased effort is recommended for non-trapping Fauna Plots. The
      effort can be increased by repeating the search on different days and time
      periods (i.e. morning and afternoon sessions under different weather and
      cloud cover conditions).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching may be conducted whilst the Fauna Plot is being
      trapped (i.e. you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods, i.e. ripping bark of trees, lifting logs etc., must
      be restricted to the outer edge of the Fauna Plot to limit disturbance.
      All rocks and timber, especially hollow logs, must be put back into place.
      Do not remove fauna refuges, or move them so they no longer provide
      refuge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods can be conducted off-plot, within 20 m of the plot
      boundary, and not within an adjacent Vegetation and Soils plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimise noise when actively searching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If ground surfaces are sandy, the surveyors should ensure time is spent
      investigating these areas to identify tracks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching can be conducted at any time during daylight
      hours. If sandy surfaces are present, mid-mornings are recommended (after
      trap checking is completed as a priority), before tracks blow away.
      However, avoid cold weather conditions as animal movements will be
      limited, thus the chance of observation will be low.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, for scat records, note the approximate age of the scat in
      the comments section - noting if it is considered fresh or old).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For track observations, note the approximate age of the track in the
      comments section, noting the track is considered fresh (i.e. overnight),
      or old – such as tracks left in heavy or previously wet soils.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record burrows, to species level where possible, based on the shape, and
      scats that may be present (use appropriate field guides such as Triggs
      (2004) and Moseby <em>et al.</em> (2012).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember to look up trees and amongst shrubs for bird nests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nocturnal-passive-searching">B. Nocturnal passive searching</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal passive search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor
      time. Increased effort is recommended for non-trapping Fauna Plots. The
      effort can be increased by repeating the search on different nights
      (rather than extending the search time for one session).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, schedule the nocturnal searches to avoid nights
      surrounding a full moon (all surveys should avoid a full moon where
      possible) if cloud cover is sparse.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal passive searching may be conducted whilst the Fauna Plot is
      being trapped (i.e. you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping). Ideally the search should commence between 1 and 2 hours after
      dark. Surveyors should take care to minimise noise and disturbance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Due to WHS concerns, nocturnal passive searches should not be conducted
      alone.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-techniques">Additional techniques</h4>
<h5 id="call-play-back-for-birds-and-frogs">
  A. Call play-back for birds and frogs
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back to encourage birds and frogs to respond, can be conducted,
      but is recommended as a separate activity, not included as part of the
      diurnal active searches, nocturnal passive searches, or bird surveys.
      Species recorded should be noted on the opportunistic observation module
      of the app, and the method noted as being ‘heard in response to call
      play-back’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back should not be undertaken within 30 minutes prior to a
      nocturnal passive search, as this may interfere with the results, i.e.
      some species have a delayed response to the calls being played.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Call play-back may be undertaken after the nocturnal passive search has
      concluded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As call play-back is not a specific method of the Vertebrate Fauna Module,
      the effort spent playing calls is not specified, however bear in mind the
      potential impact to trapping results (if the Fauna Plot is being trapped).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult field guides to determine which nocturnal bird species may be
      present in your area and habitat.

      Arrive at the Fauna Plot to be surveyed, ideally between mid-morning (i.e.
      after all traps have been checked) and mid-afternoon, avoiding cold and
      hot temperatures.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Work across the Fauna Plot (wandering is acceptable) looking for fauna, or
      indirect signs.

  <li>
    <p>
      If suitable habitat is present within the fauna plot, rake leaf litter and
      the top 2-3 cm of topsoil, carefully searching for animals, particularly
      legless lizards. Rake back any moved leaf litter.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move to the edge of the Fauna Plot (in any direction, as long as the
      habitat is homogenous with the plot), and actively search for fauna by
      lifting rocks, removing bark from trees, and lifting logs and fallen
      timber. Return rocks and logs back to their original position.

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      For each fauna observation, either a direct observation, or indirect sign
      of fauna, including tracks, scats, diggings, bones, feathers etc.,
      identifiable to the species level, select the ‘+’ symbol to add a new
      observation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A new screen will appear. Select <em>Species name</em> using the ‘lookup’.
      As you type, options will be provided by class, order, family, genus,
      species. Enter to the level you are confident of the identification (e.g.
      enter to genus level if uncertain of the species). Where an identification
      is uncertain, only record the observation if a voucher specimen, photo or
      other evidence is taken for later identification. If the identification is
      only known to the genus, manually assign a descriptive field species name
      e.g. <em>Macropus</em> ‘red legs’. Invertebrates and non-vascular flora
      are often only known to class or morphological groups.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the identification is uncertain (i.e. pending the review of evidence
      collected), switch <em>Confident</em> toggle to ‘off’ (default is ‘on’ to
      indicate the surveyor is confident). If confident at the level of entry at
      Step 5 (e.g. entered to genus level because of uncertainty of the species
      and there is no supporting evidence to refine the identification), then
      <em>Confident</em> toggle should be ‘on’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select <em>Source of identification</em> from the drop-down list. If the
      Confident toggle is ‘on’ the default selection is ‘field identification by
      observer’. If <em>Confident</em> toggle is ‘off’ the default selection
      becomes ‘awaiting identification’ and the record will be flagged for
      follow up through the curation process. For example, if evidence (e.g.
      photo, audio recording) is provided to support the record, which is later
      identified by an expert, the <em>Source of identification</em> is then
      updated to ‘identification of evidence by expert’).

  <li>
    <p>
      The date and time of the observation will be automatically recorded. Click

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Number of individuals</em> observed (zero, blank and no
