    <h3 id="protocol-overview">Protocol overview</h3>
<p>
  This protocol involves the use of a single Townes style malaise trap within
  the fauna plot. The malaise trap is positioned at a chosen location within the
  plot aimed at maximising potential captures. The trap is left in-situ for five
  (minimum) to seven (recommended) consecutive nights. Once a trap is in place,
  it can be left unattended for up to seven days before the collection bottle
  needs changing (GMP 2019; D'Souza <em>et al.</em> 2021). Trapping can be
  undertaken for a longer consecutive period of time or across different
  seasons, to build a more comprehensive picture of invertebrate activity at the
  site. If trapping is undertaken as part of the GMP, the trap is left in-situ
  for a full year, with the collection bottle replaced every seven days. The
  protocol instructions incorporate the requirements of the GMP.
</p>
<p>
  Trapping is ideally timed during periods of peak insect activity (i.e. during
  warm, sunny weather). It is important that repeat sampling is undertaken at
  the same location, at the same time of year, and during similar weather
  conditions. The results represent a snapshot of the insect community present
  within the habitat type, at a particular time of year. Sampling can be
  undertaken at more than one time throughout the year (GMP 2019; D'Souza
  <em>et al.</em> 2021).

<h4 id="trap-maintenance">A. Trap maintenance</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      GMP standard operating procedures, and instructional videos for trap
      set-up and servicing are available at
      <a href="https://biodiversitygenomics.net/resources/bioscan/"
        ><u>https://biodiversitygenomics.net/resources/bioscan/</u></a
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ethanol (as the killing agent/preserving fluid) is likely to evaporate
      faster than propylene glycol, particularly in exposed sites. This can be
      compensated by attaching a larger collection container (with more fluid)
      or by the replenishing fluid during the week (Evans 2016b).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A moth excluder can be inserted into the collecting head to prevent the
      entry of large insects such as Lepidoptera or dragonflies.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas with high vertebrate traffic (wild animals or livestock) it may
      be necessary to place a temporary barrier (e.g. chicken wire), around the
      trap location (Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019). Use of barriers/additional
      fixtures must be recorded in the comments field.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Schmidt <em>et al.</em> (2019) provides a protocol for preparing
      Lepidoptera from malaise trap samples that were preserved in ethanol.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas frequented by people, consider placing a sign next to the trap
      stating what it is, to potentially avoid the traps being tampered with.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there are consistent issues with wildlife disturbance or human
      vandalism, the trap can be relocated (GMP 2019). Ensure that all the
      details for this are recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Damaged traps should be repaired (if possible) or replaced. Faded traps
      should also be replaced. If using traps that have been damaged/or altered
      in any way, this should be recorded in the comments data field.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="samples">B. Samples</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If sorting of samples is required (depending on project aims), the time
      commitment can be considerable given the large catch volumes. Sometimes
      sub-sampling is necessary (i.e. taking a known fraction of the total
      volume, ensuring that the sample is completely mixed beforehand).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analysis-2">C. Analysis</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sorting of bulk samples is not necessary for the purpose of DNA analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Standardising data analysis is an equally important aspect of comparing
      results between sites (Hobern and Adamowicz 2021). This is beyond the
      scope of this protocol but is further discussed in Section 10.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Projects involved in the GMP send collected samples to the Centre for
      Biodiversity Genomics (Canada) for sequence analysis and DNA barcoding,
      and in return, the contributors receive a site specific summary of the
      species diversity identified for the given survey time (Centre of
      Biodiversity Genomics 2021).

        ><u>GMP standard protocol</u></a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Carry the Mobile device, Trimble® R1, malaise trap and equipment to
      install the trap, to the fauna plot, avoiding walking through the
      vegetation plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select a suitable location for the malaise trap within the fauna plot.
      Ideally, the location is reasonably flat with low or no undergrowth (at
      least 2 m x 1.5 m). Avoid areas of potential wildlife or human
      disturbance/vandalism. To maximise the catch, select a probable insect
      flight path (e.g. natural corridor, ridge, gully, forest edges, clearings,
      elevated sites, gaps between bushes, semi-enclosed pathway). In flat, open
      systems where there is no obvious corridor, select any suitable location
      within the plot; in such situations, captures may be maximised by placing
      the trap on the northern side of shrubs (if any are present).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assemble and position the malaise trap:</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assemble poles. Make sure segments are completely seated in joints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Push ends of the longer pole into pockets of the taller end of malaise
      trap. Be careful not to over bend the pole.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Clip hooks around pole. Take care to maintain gentle curve in the pole.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps with shorter pole and lower end of malaise trap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position the trap so that the vertical panels are in contact with the
      ground, the vertical panel of netting (i.e. the interception area) that
      the insects hit is oriented roughly perpendicular to the most likely
      flight path, and the head of the trap (the highest point of the trap with
      the collecting bottle) toward the end which points most toward the sun in
      the latter half of the day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peg the bottom edges so they are touching the ground.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stake out guy ropes from the poles of the top of both ends of the malaise
      trap to make it stand taut. Additional guy points can be used if
      considered necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stake base of malaise trap, especially at ends of poles, so the trap is
      taut.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When possible, tie the front and/or back ropes to nearby trees for added
      support.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Also, if available, attach the trap poles to a 6- to 8-foot dropper at its
      highest points to protect the trap against falling over from high winds,
      especially if it is placed in an exposed area.

      Check the traps during the trapping period (especially at the start of a
      monitoring program, and after strong winds or heavy rain) to ensure they
      are still in place and to monitor for and repair damage. If extreme
      weather is expected it may be necessary to remove the trap. Check the
      collection bottles. If using ethanol as the preserving fluid, evaporation
      can be an issue. If necessary, top-up the sample bottles to the 400 ml
      mark.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Malaise trapping can result in mass samples that fill the collection

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Top up the sample containers with preserving fluid (undiluted propylene
      glycol or 95% ethanol) if necessary, to prevent fluid splashing around and
      damaging the samples in the container. Return the lid and ensure it is
      screwed on tightly. For additional measure, place a small sticker barcode
      (duplicate of the code in the sample) on the side of the sample container
      – this enables the sample information to be readily retrieved without
      having to open the container and remove the label from the fluid for
      scanning.

  <li>
    <p>
      Store the containers in a cool location out of direct light. Do not leave

      analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any excess/used propylene glycol should be stored appropriately and

      Ideally, place the samples in a standard household freezer (i.e. -20°C)
      for storage. Ensure that the entire insect mass is fully submerged in
      ethanol before storage; add fresh 95% ethanol or undiluted propylene
      glycol to the sample bottle as needed. If a freezer is unavailable, store
      the samples in a refrigerator or cool, dark location. This is critical to

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Malaise traps are simple and easily operated, require the least collection
  effort of all the invertebrate sampling methods, and can result in diverse and
  abundant captures. Comparisons with other sampling methods have shown that
  malaise traps reveal a significant proportion of the local arthropod fauna
  (Evans 2016b; Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019; Centre of Biodiversity Genomics
  2021). Once a trap is in place, it can be left unattended for up to seven days
  before the collection bottle needs changing (GMP 2019; D'Souza
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). The collection bottle can be swapped or emptied without
  having to dismantle the trap (Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019). The collection
  bottles are not impacted by rainfall like some other sampling methods, which
  means malaise trapping is also suitable in areas with heavy rainfall (Skvarla
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). For these reasons, malaise trapping is a highly
  recommended sampling method, and an obvious choice when field time and funding
  is limited (Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019; Centre of Biodiversity Genomics
  2021).
</p>
<p>
  The Townes’ (1972) style malaise trap (L165 x W180 x H180 cm) is the most
  common trap design (Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021) and is the adopted
  approach of the GMP. Hence it was selected as the trap type for this protocol,
  to ensure uniformity in design (i.e. trap size, mesh size, colour and shape),
  to support comparisons within and between sites in Australia and at a global
  scale (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020; D'Souza <em>et al.</em> 2021; Montgomery
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Townes’ malaise traps are commercially available
  through entomological suppliers. The initial cost is quite high (approximately
  $500 AUD per trap) but the traps should last for a number of years; although
  Skvarla <em>et al.</em> (2020) noted that the age of traps significantly
  altered trap catch, possibly due to fading from sunlight exposure.
</p>
<p>
  The standard and most practical approach is to set the Townes’ malaise traps
  at ground level, which also corresponds with the highest activity zone for
  flying insects (Evans 2016b). If traps are suspended in the vegetation canopy,
  the height above the ground is recorded.
</p>
<p>
  High grade ethanol is prone to evaporation, only lasting one to two weeks in
  the field, whereas propylene glycol can last up to a month, making it a better
  option for traps set in areas of high temperature or low humidity (Whitman
  <em>et al.</em> 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Use of a wet killing agent is chosen over using a dry killing agent, a) for
  convenience, as the traps can be checked less often, b) for efficiency, as the
  preserved specimens do not require any field processing, c) because TERN’s
  methods are focused on rapid, bulk collection of data to facilitate potential
  future research, rather than sample processing, and most importantly, d)
  because the preserved samples are suitable for DNA analysis and metabarcoding,
  which is fast becoming the standard method for identification of bulk samples.
</p>
<p>
  The trade-off of using a wet killing agent is that delicate specimens, notably
  Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) are often damaged and lose their scales
  (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021) and colour
  (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2019), diminishing their diagnostic features and
  morphological value, making visual identification more difficult (Evans 2016b;
  Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020). However, the issue of identification is offset
  by the shift towards DNA analysis, as the agent does not result in a breakdown
  of genetic material (D'Souza <em>et al.</em> 2021). Schmidt <em>et al.</em>
  (2019) demonstrated that the study of Lepidoptera (wings, genitalia, larvae
  and eggs) was possible from wet samples, and that Lepidoptera preserved in
  ethanol could still be successfully dry-mounted. Schmidt
  <em>et al.</em> (2019) propose a workflow protocol for this, although it is
  acknowledged that entomologists may be reluctant to process imperfect samples.
</p>
<p>
  The more delicate Lepidoptera families that are difficult to mount from wet
  samples are likely to also be sampled by the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/7d74d213-3fb8-46b4-9970-2544f555e279">Light trap</a></em> protocol
  (see Section 8) (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2019), thus providing an alternative
  opportunity for dry sample collection. Where projects or institutions
  specifically require dry samples from malaise traps (e.g. to build reference
  collections or for morphological study), then use of a dry killing agent (e.g.
  naphthalene) is an option, however the traps will need to be checked daily and
  the deviations from the standard protocol reflected by the data.

  Malaise traps are tent-like traps that intercept insects in flight. They
  consist of a central wall and side walls made of fine black mesh to reduce
  visibility, and white tent material on the roof. The roof is sloped and comes
  to a funnel-like apex at the highest point, where there is a collection
  bottle. When insects intercept the walls of the trap, they climb or fly
  upwards instinctively towards the light, and are gradually funneled into the
  collection bottle (Bulbert <em>et al.</em> 2007; Evans 2016b; Whitman
  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021). This protocol adopts
  the blanket use of a wet killing agent in the collection bottle, being either
  95% ethanol or undiluted propylene glycol, both of which also function as
  effective preservatives. If participating in the Global Malaise Program (GMP),
  the specified wetting agent/preservative is 95% ethanol.

  Malaise traps predominantly catch flying insects, and are the most effective
  method for flies (Diptera) and wasps (Hymenoptera) (Schmidt
  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020). Diptera and Hymenoptera
  respectively tend to be the most dominant taxa caught in terms of numbers of
  individuals. Malaise traps also capture true bugs, bees, moths, butterflies
  and dragonflies, as well as ground-dwelling species that climb up or emerge
  from the ground below the trap (Bulbert <em>et al.</em> 2007; Evans 2016b;
  Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Malaise traps are usually deployed in contact with the ground (terrestrial
  trap), where they collect low flying and ground-dwelling species, but they can
  also be suspended in the forest canopy (canopy trap) to sample higher flying
  insects (Evans 2016b; Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020). The environment and
  location in which the trap is set will impact on the taxa that is sampled
  (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Malaise traps can be deployed in any habitat and any location within a
  habitat, where flying insects are expected. To maximise catch, traps are
  placed along flight paths, in sunny, exposed areas, in a north-south
  orientation with the trap head facing towards the afternoon sun. While
  environmental factors have been little studied, temperature and precipitation
  can reportedly have a strong influence on trap catch, with the largest catches
  recorded on hot, sunny days following rain (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The number of traps to establish will depend on the specific project
  objectives. The standard protocol is to set a single malaise trap per fauna
  plot, as this will likely yield catch results sufficient for most purposes.
  For inclusion in the GMP, and to maximise results, traps are ideally located
  in plots containing climax vegetation with minimal disturbance (GMP 2019). For
  large project areas, malaise trapping is ideally undertaken across multiple
  plots, including replicates of the same habitat, because results can be highly
  variable and are sensitive to microhabitat variation (Montgomery
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Before establishing multiple traps, the practicalities
  of post-field processing and storage of large catch volumes needs to be
  considered (Bulbert <em>et al.</em> 2007; Evans 2016b).
</p>
<p>
  Malaise trapping has been combined with the use of light traps and pan traps
  in some studies (i.e. pan traps strategically placed to catch insects that
  drop after intercepting with the malaise trap), for efficiency in capturing
  diverse taxa (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021).
  This approach is not supported because it confounds the results and makes
  comparisons difficult. However, the sampling methods can be deployed
  independently of each other to provide a more complete picture of the
  invertebrate fauna present. In particular, malaise traps and micro-pitfall
  traps, both collect highly diverse arthropod assemblages but have little
  overlap in the species they sample, so are complementary techniques when
  trying to assess overall biodiversity with a limited number of techniques
  (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The focus of this protocol is the field collection of bulk invertebrate
  samples preserved for long-term storage and future DNA analysis. The protocol
  is consistent with the requirements of the GMP, which involves large-scale
  standardised malaise trapping by contributors across the globe. It is
  envisaged that the taxa sampled will be identified via DNA barcoding and
  metabarcoding, making this a time and cost-efficient method for assessing
  arthropod biodiversity (Centre of Biodiversity Genomics 2021).
