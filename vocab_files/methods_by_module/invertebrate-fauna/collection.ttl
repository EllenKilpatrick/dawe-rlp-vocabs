    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module covers the procedures and guidelines
  for the field capture and preservation of terrestrial invertebrate fauna. This
  module is undertaken within fauna monitoring plots, adjacent to the vegetation
  and soil plots. <a href='#figure-1'>Figure 1</a> shows the layout for the protocols that are
  undertaken at fixed locations within the plot.
</p>
<p>
  The module offers nine sampling protocols, targeting different invertebrate
  groups, as summarised in <a href='#table-2'>Table 2</a>. The survey design and equipment for each
  protocol is standardised to ensure comparability of the results across
  projects. Where applicable, the protocols follow existing, established
  protocols and draw on current research. Users determine which of the nine
  protocols should be undertaken for their project needs; at a minimum the
  <em>Active search</em> and <em>Micro-pitfall trapping</em> protocols are
  undertaken at the start of a project, and <em>Micro-pitfall trapping</em> is
  repeated for monitoring. Implementing a range of complementary sampling
  protocols is strongly recommended, especially at the start of a project, to
  provide a baseline for inventory and monitoring. A post-field protocol covers
  the requirements for sample curation relevant to all protocols.
</p>
<p>
  The need to undertake the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module and,
  subsequently, the selection of sampling protocols is determined at the start
  of a project depending on the project objectives and their suitability for the
  situation. The results and project objectives should also inform which
  protocols to repeat, and how often. Repeat sampling using a range of methods
  increases the ability to detect different indicator species/functional groups,
  and therefore monitor trends.
</p>
<p>
  The protocols are ideally undertaken at the same time as the vertebrate fauna
  and vegetation and soil monitoring (with consideration given to season). The
  number of plots that require sampling will be determined at the start of the
  project (see <em>Introduction</em> Chapter). The repeat survey interval will
  depend on the project and the protocol. For comparability of the data, repeat
  surveys should be undertaken at the same time(s) of year, moon phase and
  during similar weather conditions. If the conditions are unsuitable, the
  sampling period is rescheduled or if this is not possible, any deviations in
  the sampling conditions are recorded.
</p>
<p>
  All invertebrate catch is preserved (for each trap and each trapping period)
  and stored for future analysis, generally as bulk, mixed samples (reflecting
  how they were collected in the field) until identification is required,
  available or affordable. Samples can be sorted (e.g. into RTU’s and
  life-stages). Specimen identification and DNA analysis will require expert
  input. The <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module is linked to the following
  modules:

          >Plot selection and layout</a
        >
        –</em
      >
      before commencing the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module, the
      <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module must be completed to mark out
      the fauna plot with high accuracy using the Trimble® R1.

          >Soils</a
        ></em

      – the soil samples collected for the <em>Soils</em> module provide the
      opportunity to detect invertebrate fauna through eDNA.

          >Vertebrate fauna</a
        ></em
      >
      – invertebrates may be opportunistically collected in vertebrate fauna
      traps. The selection of vertebrate fauna protocols (full or lite) may
      dictate the selection of micro-pitfall trapping protocol (full or lite).
      The timing of invertebrate sampling will need to consider any impacts on
      vertebrate fauna trapping (e.g. light trapping could influence vertebrate
      fauna trap results).

          >Targeted survey</a
        ></em
      >
      – the results of the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module sampling may be a
      trigger for targeted survey. If biosecurity (i.e. monitoring for potential
      incursion of exotic pests) is a specific focus, sampling methods outside
      of those listed in the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module may be more
      appropriate to enable rapid detection of taxa – use the
      <em>Targeted Survey</em> module in such instances.

          >Opportunistic observations module</a
        ></em
      >
      – invertebrates can also be collected opportunistically (within and
      outside the plot) as part of the
      <em>Opportunistic observations</em> module. The opportunity for
      opportunistic sampling of invertebrates may occur during systematic
      sampling. The <em>Opportunistic observations</em> module can be
      quick-accessed from within the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module to
      record such records.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The invertebrate sampling results can be analysed in relation to attribute
  data collected in the adjoining vegetation plot. For example, the abundance of
  invertebrate captures could be analysed in relation to: plant type, plant
  cover and phenology collected as part of the

        organism). eDNA is biological material, such as shed cells, excrement,
        exuvia and reproductive secretions among other sources, that is
        continuously released into the environment by all living macro-organisms
        (Valentin et al. 2020). eDNA can be collected within samples of soil,

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>
  Invertebrates are the least studied fauna group but constitute the majority of
  species richness, abundance and biomass within terrestrial ecosystems (Oraby
  2013; Barnett and Facey 2016; Evans 2016a; Williams 2020). An estimated
  275,000 to 300,000 species of terrestrial invertebrates occur in Australia,
  including a large proportion of endemic and undescribed species (Australian
  Museum 2021). Few invertebrate groups have been studied in detail and the
  ecology of most invertebrates, particularly of their immature stages, remains
  poorly known (Williams 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Invertebrates are a critical component of all terrestrial ecosystems (Ward and
  Larivière 2004; Kwok <em>et al.</em> 2016; Scudder 2017). They encompass a
  range of functional groups including herbivores, pollinators, predators,
  parasitoids and detritivores, as well as providing an important food source
  for other animals. They play critical roles in ecosystem services and are
  involved in complex interactions across multiple trophic levels (Lavelle
  <em>et al.</em> 2006; Prather <em>et al.</em> 2013; Kwok <em>et al.</em> 2016;
  Scudder 2017). Despite this, invertebrates have long been overlooked in
  environmental monitoring because of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Sampling</strong> – lack of standard protocols, vast array of taxa
      dependent sampling methods, survey biases, influence of other variables
      (e.g. weather, the overwhelming number of species (many undescribed) and
      individual specimens obtained from limited sampling, the considerable
      variability in results over short periods of time, the cryptic nature of
      some taxa making them hard to find, and cost;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Identification</strong> – high proportion of undescribed species,
      lack of expertise and specialists to process and identify specimens, time,
      and cost;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Knowledge</strong> – limited knowledge regarding their
      distribution and status, interactions with their environment, their
      ecological roles, how they influence ecosystem function and respond to
      change, and therefore appropriate taxa to monitor;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Preservation</strong> – lack of standard protocols, cost, and
      storage;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Value</strong> – generally undervalued by the public, lack of
      appreciation of their ecological importance and a lack of regulatory
      frameworks, which makes it difficult to secure funding (Oliver and Beattie
      1996; Ward and Larivière 2004; Prather <em>et al.</em> 2013; Evans 2016a;
      Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-monitor-invertebrates">Why monitor invertebrates</h3>
<p>
  Global insect declines (Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021; Noskov
  <em>et al.</em> 2021) have prompted a greater focus on invertebrate monitoring
  and with progress in ecosystem science (Yu <em>et al.</em> 2021), there is
  also wider acceptance of the vital roles invertebrates play in ecosystem
  function and the need to incorporate them into environmental monitoring
  programs. Invertebrates are considered good indicators of environmental change
  due to their abundance, diversity, ease of collection, ecological importance,
  fast growth rates and population turnover, environmental sensitivity and rapid
  responses to change (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002; Ward and Larivière 2004; Oraby
  2013). Their diversity also provides ecosystem resilience (the ability to
  survive change) by increasing the number of alternative pathways in food webs
  (Evans 2016a).
</p>
<p>
  Monitoring that incorporates a range of functional invertebrate groups can
  identify patterns in composition, diversity and environmental condition, at
  more meaningful scales than can be measured using plants and vertebrate fauna
  (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002; Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2004; Ward and Larivière
  2004). Monitoring in response to management efforts also provides an
  indication of the processes that restore and maintain ecosystems (Pik
  <em>et al.</em> 2002).
</p>
<p>
  Very limited information exists for the status and trends on invertebrates.
  However, the key pressures on Australia's invertebrates are increasing
  (Cresswell and Murphy 2017). Forty-eight terrestrial invertebrate species are
  listed as threatened in Australia (as at September 2021) (Australian
  Government Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment 2021). With
  many natural habitats being fragmented and disturbed, and the vast majority of
  invertebrate fauna yet to be identified, the true number of threatened
  invertebrate species could be far greater. Consequently, widespread survey and
  monitoring are essential to better understand the status of invertebrate
  species across Australia. In addition, a number of introduced invertebrates
  are present in Australia and the arrival of new invertebrate pests represents
  an ongoing biosecurity risk that could have a detrimental impact on natural
  and agricultural systems (Department of Agriculture 2021). Baseline surveys
  and monitoring are essential for the prompt detection and eradication of
  invertebrate incursions.
</p>
<h3 id="which-taxa-to-target">Which taxa to target</h3>
<p>
  Invertebrates can indicate environmental change at different levels. For
  example, the response to a site-specific disturbance may be detected at a
  population level of a specific species, whereas monitoring long-term ecosystem
  change and the conservation value of a specific site may be better indicated
  by the whole invertebrate community.
</p>
<p>
  Attempting to monitor all invertebrate taxa is impractical and unrealistic, in
  terms of field effort, cost, specimen sorting, identification and curation
  (Oliver and Beattie 1996; Harvey et al. 2011). Hence it is common practice to
  select focal taxa as bio-indicators and surrogates for total biodiversity.
  There are no set criteria for selecting which taxa to target, however factors
  to consider include the:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>aims of the project and the specific purpose of monitoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>influences that are thought to be acting and predicted taxa response</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sensitivity of the taxa to environmental change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      biological reliability of the taxa (i.e. how well they represent other
      taxa)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      practicality of sampling (i.e. abundant, diverse, taxonomically
      manageable, readily sampled)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      predicted taxa response (McGeoch 1998; Hodkinson and Jackson 2005;
      Oberprieler <em>et al.</em> 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The invertebrate groups commonly selected for terrestrial ecosystem monitoring
  include ants, ground beetles, sucking bugs, spiders and land snails, and to a
  lesser extent butterflies (Stanisic et al. 2005). Other invertebrate groups
  may be equally useful for monitoring, but are less well studied - refer to
  <em>Supplementary information</em> for a list of the taxa most commonly
  selected as bio-indicators, including a summary of their traits and the most
  suitable protocols for monitoring them.
</p>
<p>
  The response to change can vary significantly between and within taxa groups
  (i.e. some species may have a positive response and others a negative response
  to a change), highlighting the complexity of interactions and in interpreting
  the results (Oliver and Beattie 1996; Ward and Larivière 2004; Zhao et al.
  2013). Few studies have identified if the response of indicator species or
  groups is representative of other taxa (Ward and Larivière 2004). Selecting a
  number of complementary focal taxa across different functional groups and
  different distribution patterns (referred to as a broad “shopping basket”
  approach) can provide a more accurate assessment and better detect trends in
  overall invertebrate diversity (Oliver and Beattie 1996; Ward and Larivière
  2004; Hodkinson and Jackson 2005; Oberprieler <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Another approach is focusing on ‘sentinel taxa’, being invertebrate groups
  that comprise species of varying lifespans and generation times, and wide
  geographic distributions, for which occurrence data are extensively available.
  Sentinel taxa are considered representative of the response of the larger
  invertebrate community and hence suitable to forecast the effects of ecosystem
  change (Hoekman <em>et al.</em> 2017).
</p>
<p>
  Projects focused on agricultural productivity may target invertebrates known
  to have a direct response on yields, such as bees and specific invertebrate
  pests. Restoration projects may target ants, which are ubiquitous, easy to
  sample with wet micro-pitfall traps, and known to respond readily to habitat
  change (Andersen et al. 2004; Stanisic et al. 2005; Majer and Framenau 2017).
  Focal taxa may also be selected in response to specific disturbances, such as
  fire (DAWE 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Environmental assessments often focus on conservation of significant species
  (under national and state legislation) as well as short-range endemic (SRE)
  taxa, which are those that have naturally small distributions and life history
  traits that make them vulnerable to habitat loss, habitat degradation and
  climate change. The terrestrial invertebrate groups known or likely to contain
  SRE’s include trapdoor spiders, pseudoscorpions, schizomids, millipedes,
  slaters, land snails, earthworms, velvet worms, mites and others (Harvey et
  al. 2011; Majer and Framenau 2017).
</p>
<p>
  The methods in this module may detect threatened species and SREs, however
  effectively monitoring such species may require a targeted survey approach
  because they may be small, difficult to detect, have a seasonal or irregular
  occurrence, have a narrow distribution (e.g. restricted to particular sites or
  micro-habitats), occupy specialised habitats, be host-specific, and form
  complex population structures across the landscape (Braby 2018).
</p>
<h3 id="which-sampling-methods">Which sampling methods</h3>
<p>
  There is no ‘one method fits all’ approach to sampling given the vast number
  of invertebrate species and their different physical, biological and
  ecological characteristics (Oliver and Beattie 1996). Many sampling methods
  and variations to those methods exist, and each has sampling biases and will
  reveal different types of invertebrates (Sherley and Stringer 2016). The
  selection of which sampling method/s to use will depend on the project aims
  and the target taxa, and should consider consistency, reliability, and
  precision (Spafford and Lortie 2013).
</p>
<p>
  A review of invertebrate sampling methods was undertaken to inform the
  selection of the nine methods (six passive and three active sampling) included
  in this module - refer to <em>Supplementary information</em>. The sampling
  protocols were chosen because of their efficacy across a range of terrestrial
  habitats, ability to be implemented in a standardised manner, relatively
  simple methodologies that can be consistently applied that use equipment that
  is readily available, and wide acceptance and use by the entomological
  research community, enabling comparisons with existing datasets. A brief
  rationale for each method is provided under the individual protocols.
</p>
<p>
  The methods recommended by Montgomery <em>et al.</em> (2021) for insect
  monitoring and benchmarking have been included in this module, with the
  exception of acoustic monitoring, which is provided as an option within the
  <em>Targeted survey</em> module (see <a href='#table-2'>Table 2</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The passive sampling methods are easier to standardise, and capture many
  invertebrates with minimal effort (Queensland Museum 2005; Sherley and Evans
  2016). The active sampling methods enable associations to be identified
  between invertebrates and host plants/habitat components that are not possible
  via passive methods and help create an inventory of species.
</p>
<p>
  The protocols included in this module complement each other, and although
  there is overlap in the taxa sampled by some protocols, each will reveal
  different species and families within the assemblage (Spafford and Lortie
  2013; Houghton <em>et al.</em> 2019; Prendergast <em>et al.</em> 2020).
  Undertaking a range of protocols is recommended to obtain more comprehensive
  results, for inventory and community level monitoring (Cane et al. 2000; King
  and Porter 2005; Berglund and Milberg 2019). This holds true even for small
  project areas (Basset et al. 2020). Using a combination of active and passive
  sampling methods maximises estimates of species richness and abundance within
  invertebrate communities and ultimately increases the ability to detect
  changes in response to disturbances and treatments (Spafford and Lortie 2013).
</p>
<p>
  A summary of the effectiveness of sampling methods for the different
  terrestrial invertebrate groups is provided in Upton et al. (2010). Decision
  trees are provided in the <a href="#appendices">Appendix</a> to help with the selection of the most
  suitable protocol/s.
</p>
<p>
  For environmental impact assessment, a primary focus is determining if
  conservation significant and SRE invertebrate species are present. The
  selection of sampling methods will be informed by an assessment of their
  likelihood of occurrence (see <em>Desktop Assessment</em> Chapter), although
  this is difficult for invertebrates given the general lack of information
  available on their spatial distribution and habitat requirements. Sampling
  method selection will depend on the species of interest, the nature, size and
  condition of the survey area, and the habitat suitability. Using a combination
  of sampling methods is appropriate when surveying for conservation significant
  and SRE species to have certainty that the majority of those present at the
  time of the survey are recorded (Majer and Framenau 2017). This may include
  systematic plot surveys, targeted survey and opportunistic survey outside of
  plots, targeting particular habitat features. Survey for SRE’s should also
  follow technical guidance, see EPA (2016).
</p>
<p>
  All protocols involve destructive sampling, deemed appropriate at this point
  in time for definitive taxonomic identification, detecting cryptic species,
  biogeography, future proofing, developing reference libraries and for
  potential research (Nève 2012; Hoekman <em>et al.</em> 2017). Destructive
  methods can be problematic for long-term studies because they can reduce the
  overall abundance of invertebrates in the local area (Sherley and Stringer
  2016), impacting on repeat survey results. The effects of destructive sampling
  are in part mitigated by the spatial separation between monitoring plots, the
  restricted number of traps/sampling location per plot and the temporal
  restrictions in sampling.
</p>
<p>
  Potentially, this module will be updated as new technologies change the
  approach to invertebrate monitoring (Cardim Ferreira Lima
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). Emerging, novel, cost-effective approaches to
  invertebrate monitoring include eDNA, use of drones, remote sensing, ‘smart
  cameras’ using automatic image recognition and machine learning, e.g.(Hogeweg
  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Cardim Ferreira Lima <em>et al.</em> 2020; Löcken
  <em>et al.</em> 2020; Valentin <em>et al.</em> 2020; Noskov
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). If a project has an existing invertebrate monitoring
  program, then continued use of those methods is justified in that monitoring
  context; in such cases the <em>Targeted Survey</em> module can be used to
  record the data.
</p>
<h3 id="why-a-standardised-approach">Why a standardised approach</h3>
<p>
  The lack of clear survey guidelines has been an impediment to the broadscale
  implementation of terrestrial invertebrate surveys (Ward and Larivière 2004;
  Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021). Published studies
  highlight many variations exist in sampling protocols (e.g. trap design and
  sampling technique, configuration and intensity, preservatives used), and this
  limits the ability to compare results across studies. In addition, sampling
  protocols are often poorly reported, which limits the ability to re-use
  methods across studies (Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery
  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and few studies include the necessary number of
  replicates and repeated sampling to monitor long-term change (Montgomery
  <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  Standardisation in sampling protocols, using reliable and cost-effective
  methods is considered essential for effective long-term invertebrate
  monitoring. It enables comparison and consolidation of datasets, and allows
  the biases influencing capture and retention rates to be further investigated
  and understood, which may lead to future design improvements (Oliver and
  Beattie 1996; Ward and Larivière 2004; Gibb <em>et al.</em> 2017; O'Connor
  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  Standardised metadata capture, utilising accepted metadata schemas, supports
  data sharing, reuse and systems interoperability. The digital capture of data
  via the App automates as much metadata capture as possible, reducing the
  amount of time spent manually entering data and ensuring data is collected in
  a consistent way. Open-access to centralised, clean, digital data greatly
  enhances the ability to generate large-scale datasets for macro-analysis
  (Brown and Matthews 2016; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021). The data can also
  feed into other databases (e.g. the Atlas of Living Australia) and global
  monitoring networks (e.g., the Global Malaise Program) (Montgomery
  <em>et al.</em> 2021).
</p>
<p>
  The timing of invertebrate surveys must be standardised as much as possible to
  reduce the effect of environmental factors and seasonal variability on the
  results. Repeat sampling across years is therefore undertaken during the same
  time period, the same moon phase, and the same (as much as possible) weather
  conditions, for the same duration of sampling event (Patrick 2016).

  The <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module provides standardised protocols for
  sampling terrestrial invertebrate fauna, within the fauna monitoring plots.
  Terrestrial invertebrates are extremely diverse, prolific, and have adapted to
  occupy nearly every ecological niche (Australian Museum 2021). They include

  The focus of the <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module is collecting invertebrate
  taxa, to monitor long-term trends, the influence of disturbances and
  management practices, and to better understand the relationships underlying
  ecosystem function and maintenance. The invertebrates sampled help to build a
  baseline inventory for the areas surveyed, and samples provide the opportunity
  for future research.
</p>
<p>
  Invertebrate surveys are generally undertaken at the same time as the
  vertebrate fauna survey, for efficiency, and so trends between vertebrate and
  invertebrate fauna can be assessed. Ideally, the timing of invertebrate
  surveys also corresponds with the monitoring undertaken in the adjoining
  vegetation and soil plot, so that the data can be related to the plant
  resources, leaf-litter and soil conditions in the local environment at the
  time.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Invertebrate fauna</em> module offers flexibility in the selection of
  sampling protocols depending on the suitability of the site, the project
  objectives, how the sampling methods complement each other, budget and
  logistical constraints. Some of the sampling methods are rapid and others are
  undertaken over multiple days, at the same time as the
  <em>Vertebrate fauna</em> module.
</p>
<p>
  Nine protocols for invertebrate sampling are included in this module,
  including passive and active sampling methods (also see <a href='#table-2'>Table 2</a> in Module
  overview).

  These sampling methods are widely accepted across the entomological community,
  suitable for use across most terrestrial ecosystems, and deliver efficient and
  quantifiable results. The methods target different invertebrate types,
  including day and night active, ground-active and flying, plant inhabiting,
  and litter and soil dwelling taxa. The methods are non-selective, meaning each
  survey method can capture a range of invertebrate taxa, with some cross-over
  between the methods.
</p>
<p>
  Standardised design and sampling equipment is specified for all protocols, in
  line with established protocols (where relevant), recent literature,
  technological advances and the advice of invertebrate specialists (Stanisic et
  al. 2005; Bulbert et al. 2007; Upton et al. 2010; LeBuhn et al. 2016; Sherley
  and Stringer 2016; Department of Conservation 2021; Montgomery et al. 2021;
  University of New South Wales Accessed 2021).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Micro-pitfall trapping</em> and <em>Active search</em> protocols are
  the minimum requirement if undertaking this module. Micro-pitfall trapping is
  the most common and successful survey method for surface dwelling
  invertebrates, and is commonly used to monitor bioindicator species (i.e.
  those species most responsive to change) (Andersen and Majer 2004; Oraby
  2013). Active search is undertaken at the start of a project, for inventory
  purposes.
</p>
<p>
  The other protocols are optional, but the more protocols undertaken, the more
  comprehensive the results, providing a better representation of the
  invertebrate diversity present. Undertaking a complementary selection of the
  protocols at the start of a project helps to build a baseline of the
  invertebrate community present, and identify focal taxa for ongoing
  monitoring, thus informing the protocols to select for repeated sampling.
  Focusing ongoing monitoring efforts on key taxa (e.g. those considered
  ‘bio-indicators’) is regarded as a better approach than trying to cover all
  species (Andersen and Majer 2004).
</p>
<p>
  Invertebrate activity and trap efficiency are strongly influenced by
  environmental factors such as the weather, and the response to these factors
  varies between taxa. Timing is key to obtaining comparable trapping results,
  and repeat sampling should be undertaken at the same time of year, same moon
  phase and during similar weather conditions (Brown and Matthews 2016; Evans
  2016b). In areas with unpredictable rainfall, standardising the sampling time
  in relation to a recent rainfall event may be more important than
  standardising the month of sampling (Callan et al. 2011).
</p>
<p>
  Peak periods for invertebrate sampling (i.e. when activity is highest) is
  September to April in eastern Australia, following the wet season in northern
  Australia, in the cooler months in southern and south-western Australia, and
  in the weeks following good rainfall in the arid areas of central Australia.
  Other times of year are still useful for monitoring and may reveal different
  species and life-stages, including some less common species (Upton
  <em>et al.</em> 2010).
</p>
<p>
  Accurately and consistently recording survey metadata, including the location
  of traps, the micro-habitat at trap sites and the weather conditions during
  sampling events is important for repeatability and determining environmental
  relationships (Montgomery et al. 2021). The standardised sampling design
  enables comparison of species richness, composition and abundance within and
  between plots and overtime. For monitoring purposes, data is best analysed on
  an individual species basis (Sherley and Stringer 2016). There are a multitude
  of different applications for the data obtained (see Section 15.2).
</p>
<p>
  All invertebrate samples are retained, and in most circumstances preserved in
  95% ethanol or undiluted propylene glycol to enable DNA analysis and future
  research (Majer and Framenau 2017). For inventory and environmental impact
  assessment purposes, comprehensive sorting and taxonomic identification by
  invertebrate specialists is generally required. For long-term ecosystem
  monitoring (repeated sampling of plots), samples are typically sorted at a
  coarse level into orders or recognizable taxonomic units (RTUs), with an
  emphasis on indicator species (Chinn 2017b). It is envisaged that advances in
  DNA analysis and the development of invertebrate barcode libraries will enable
  future rapid identification of mixed invertebrate samples.
</p>
<p>
  Where the research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey
  design or require the use of other sampling methods, the
  <em>Targeted survey</em> module should be used. In addition, the detection of
  new, threatened, poorly known or pest species may trigger the need for
  targeted surveys. Any opportune invertebrate observations (i.e. made without
  standardised field protocols and without explicit sampling design) should be
  recorded using the <em>Opportunistic observations</em> module. Surveys must be
  undertaken in accordance with the permits and licences held.
