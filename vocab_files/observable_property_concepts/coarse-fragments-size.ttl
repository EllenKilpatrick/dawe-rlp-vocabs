    skos:definition "The size of coarse soil fragments (i.e. particles > 2 mm). They include unattached rock fragments and other fragments such as charcoal and shell. The scale adopted employs class boundaries at (2 Ã— 10n/2) mm, where n is an integer. This system is an extension of that used for particles smaller than 2 mm both in the scheme of the British Standards Institution and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the original Atterberg (1905) scheme on which the International Scheme was based. It is thus compatible with both the International Scheme referred to in the field texture section and the grain size criteria for substrate materials." ;
