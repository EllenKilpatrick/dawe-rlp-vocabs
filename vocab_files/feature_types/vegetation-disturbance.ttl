    dcterms:description "Vegetation disturbance occurs at multiple temporal and spatial scales (Pickett and White, 1985). The main sources of variation in disturbance include difference in ecosystem scale, the type of disturbance and differences in the disturbance regime. Disturbance can be described in terms of their distribution, frequency, cycle/turnover time, rotation period, predictability, area, magnitude/intensity, severity and synergism with other disturbances (Pickett and White, 1985). Most disturbance produce heterogenous and patchy effects (Pickett and White, 1985)." ;
