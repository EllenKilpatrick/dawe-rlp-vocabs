    dcterms:description "A vegetation stand is a sample of a plant community (see Mueller-Dombois & Ellenberg 1974; Allen & Hoekstra 1992). Usually vegetation stands are selected on the basis of uniformity and discreteness (Van Der Maarel and Franklin, 2013). The vegetation included in the stand looks uniform and should be discernible from surrounding vegetation (Van Der Maarel and Franklin, 2013)." ;
