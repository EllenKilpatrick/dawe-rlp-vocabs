    urnp:conceptDefinition "Water is removed from the soil so slowly that the watertable remains at or near the surface for most of the year. Surface flow; groundwater and subsurface flow are major sources of water; although precipitation may be important where there is a perched watertable and precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth; and often occur in depressed sites. Strong gleying and accumulation of surface organic matter are usually features of most soils." ;
