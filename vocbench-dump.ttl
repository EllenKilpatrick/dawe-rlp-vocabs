    skos:definition "<p><strong>Plot</strong> The specific survey area where information is collected (generally 100 m x 100 m; 1 ha). Final plot location and layout is generally determined in the field, with preference given to homogeneous areas representative of the broader study area, with a constant mix of vegetation, slope, relief and soil.</p><p><strong>Landform Pattern</strong> Landform patterns have dimensions of approximately 600 m and are based on the following attributes – relief, modal slope, stream channel occurrence, mode of geomorphological activity, geomorphological agent, status of geomorphological agent and component landform elements. Landform patterns generally have longer histories than landform elements. There are approximately 40 different landform patterns that are present in Australia.</p><p><strong>Landform Element</strong> Landform elements have a dimension of approximately 40 m but can vary from a few metres to 100 m. A landform element is described by the following elements – slope, morphological type, dimensions, geomorphological activity and geomorphological agent. Landform elements make up a mosaic within landform patterns. There are approximately 80 different landform elements that occur in Australia.</p><p><strong>NVIS</strong> National Vegetation Information System – a comprehensive data system that provides information on the extent and distribution of vegetation types across Australia.</p><p><strong>Relief</strong> The difference in elevation between the high and low points of a land surface.</p><p><strong>Slope</strong> The rise or fall of the land surface, that is neither a crest nor a depression and has an inclination greater than approximately 1%. Slope should be measured over a distance of at least 20 m, to reduce influence of any microrelief changes.</p><p><strong>Aspect</strong> Identifies the downslope direction (orientation) of the slope and the reading is taken looking down the slope. Due north is recorded as 360 degrees. Aspect can only have a value of 1 to 360 degrees. A value of 0 indicates that there is no slope.</p><p><strong>Toposequence</strong> The sequence of landform elements down a slope.</p><p><strong>Surface Strew Size</strong> Size of any surface stones or rocks in millimetres. The size is recorded using three size classes from 5 to 250 mm.</p><p><strong>Surface Strew Lithology</strong> Dominant lithology of any surface stones or rocks (i.e. calcrete/limestone, sandstone or quartz).</p><p><strong>Outcrop Lithology</strong> Dominant lithology of the outcrop (any area of exposed rock that is assumed to be continuous with the underlying bedrock).</p><p><strong>Homogeneity Measure</strong> Record of the visual estimate (in metres) of the shortest distance from the survey location to a vegetation community different to the one that you are sampling. Provides an indication of how far the community you are sampling extends beyond the plot.</p><p><strong>Structural Formation</strong> Vegetation classification based on growth form (e.g. tree, sedge), height and percent cover (i.e. woodland, open grassland).</p>" ;

<li><p>Site description information should be collected at the end of the plot survey when the observer is familiar with the landscape and plant species have been identified or assigned a field name in the <em>Floristics</em> Module.</p></li>
<li><p>For an overview and short description of the different landform and lithology classes refer to the <em>Landform Resources and Cheat Sheets</em> at the end of this module or click on the <em>info</em> buttons within the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The slope class is derived from the degree value entered and is automatically populated by the app. Slope class can help inform landform element, so slope information should be collected before the landform element field is populated.</p></li>
<li><p>Slope can be measured with a clinometer or a compass. Refer to the supporting information at the end of this module for details on measuring slope.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a clinometer, ensure that slope is recorded in degrees and not as a percent.</p></li>
<li><p>If the observer is not confident determining lithology in the field, this information can be sourced from relevant spatial datasets for the region. This information should be reviewed before the field survey and a copy taken to the field to assist with the lithology classification.</p></li>
<li><p>Vegetation structural information is derived from the dominant growth form, height and cover for the community. Refer to the <em>Vegetation Resources and Cheat Sheets</em> at the end of this document for a matrix of all potential options. All options are listed on the drop-down menu. If unsure, the vegetation structural information will be easier to assign after the NVIS Level 5 description has been completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The homogeneity measure is a record of the visual estimate (in metres) of the shortest distance from the plot centre to a vegetation community different to the one you are sampling in. Where there is uncertainty, it is recommended that this measure be an under-estimate (better to be conservative when estimating the distance). Where it is not possible to directly observe the distance to a different community (i.e. goes over dune crest), estimate the furthest distance that you are sure is within the same community (i.e. as far as you can still see the vegetation community from the point you are standing).</p></li>
<li><p>Vegetation information is collected is consistent with the association level (Level 5) of the NVIS. Enter up to three dominant species for each stratum, where present. Information does not need to be entered for all species or all stratum. For example, if the association only has two dominant ground storey species and no upper or mid storey, then information only needs to be entered for G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the supporting information, which includes vegetation structural diagrams for a range of different vegetation types. These can be used to help define G<sub>1-3</sub>, M<sub>1-3</sub> and U<sub>1-3</sub> for your plot.</p></li>
<li><p>For a list of growth forms, height classes and cover codes, refer to the <em>Vegetation Resources and Cheat Sheets</em> at the end of this module or click on the info button within the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The following growth forms are allowed for each stratum:</p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p>Upper – trees, tree mallee.</p></li>
<li><p>Middle – shrubs, low trees, mallee shrubs, tall grasses, grass trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Ground – grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, lichens, low shrubs, ferns, grass trees.</p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p>Only species that fall into the growth forms associated with each stratum will be available in the drop-down list for that layer (i.e. only species classified as trees or tree mallees can be selected from the upper storey species lists).</p></li>
<li><p>Once the NVIS information has been entered based on individual species and stratum, the app will generate the NVIS Level 5 description. It is good practice to review this description and if needed, make any amendments to the data entered, before clicking <em>Save</em>. This information can be cross-checked against the association descriptions from the <em>Cover</em> module and <em>Vegetation Mapping</em> module, where appropriate.</p></li>

    tern:purpose "<p>The use of standardised terminology for the collection of site information ensures sites are described in a consistent manner across projects and locations, and this facilitates the development of comprehensive datasets that can be used more widely (The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009). Collecting consistent information regarding the physical environment of sites can improve understanding of interactions between the environment and vegetation, capture important information about the landform under survey and allow site summary data to be compared between different sites and across projects (Heard and Channon 1997; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).</p><p>The use of standardised methods to classify vegetation across a range of different projects ensures consistent, cross jurisdictional vegetation classification, improves vegetation classification in data-poor areas, and allows comparison of data across regions, and under different disturbance, management and climatic regimes (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017; Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018). The classification of vegetation communities based on associations between floristic and structural data is vital to inform biodiversity planning and management, including natural resources management, environmental impact assessments, and conservation and restoration projects. Furthermore, vegetation classification is integral to Australian biodiversity laws and regulations (Gellie <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>The NVIS framework is the nationally adopted method for classifying and mapping native vegetation in Australia and provides a comprehensive way of describing and representing vegetation types based on structural and floristic measures (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017). The concept of dominance is central to the construction of NVIS vegetation descriptions and rankings are used for comparisons of the structural properties of strata, species and genera within a stratum and growth forms (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017).</p>" ;
    tern:scope "<p>The <em>Plot Description</em> module records basic physical information about the plot, including landform, slope and aspect, lithology, disturbance, climate (wet or dry) and vegetation type (Heard and Channon 1997; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009). The information collected aligns with the <em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em> (also known as the Yellow Book; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009), <em>Guidelines for Surveying Soil and Land Resources</em> (also known as the Blue Book; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008) and the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) <em>Australian Vegetation Attribute Manual</em> (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017).</p><p>For the purpose of this module, a plot is considered an area of land representative of the landform, vegetation and land surfaces present within a study area (The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009). Plot locations are generally determined in the field based on areas with homogeneous vegetation, slope, relief and soil (White <em>et al.</em> 2012). As a standard, plots are 100 m by 100 m (1 ha) in size, but in some cases plot shape may need to be altered to align with landscape features such as a dune crest or watercourse (White <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>Landform information is generally collected as a landform pattern and landform element. The key determinants of landform element are relief and stream position, while slope and the position in the toposequence are key determinants of landform element (Heard and Channon 1997; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009). There are approximately 40 different landform patterns defined for Australia, including flood plains, dunefields and hills and approximately 80 landform elements, which form a mosaic within landform patterns. Landform elements include cliffs, footslopes and valley flats (The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009). A variety of land surface attributes are also measured, including slope, aspect, surface strew size and lithology. Slope and aspect record both the degree and orientation of the slope, with aspect a measure of the downslope direction of the slope (Heard and Channon 1997). Surface strew size and lithology (surface strew and outcrop) are a measure of the dominant rock type and size of any surface stones or outcrops (Heard and Channon 1997; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>Vegetation is generally classified based on attributes including the floristic composition, vertical and horizontal structure, plant morphology and condition (De Cáceres 2013). Assigning a vegetation classification consistent with Level 5 (association) of the NVIS provides a simple, consistent description of the vegetation and its structural complexity (White <em>et al.</em> 2012). At Level 5, the dominant growth form, height, cover and species (to a maximum of 3 species) are recorded for each of the three main strata (Upper, Mid and Ground; NVIS Technical Working Group 2017). A homogeneity measure of the shortest extent of the vegetation community present is also collected to assist with vegetation classification and mapping (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p>Supporting information, including climate and disturbance provides an indication of the reliability of the vegetation data in terms of species diversity and the abundance of seasonal vegetation (which depends on preceding rainfall and other weather conditions), and helps document other pressures on the vegetation such as grazing (Heard and Channon 1997; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>" ;
